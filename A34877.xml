            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the INHABITANTS of NORTH-CADBURY in SOMERSETSHIRE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Loving Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SOme years ſince, when I ſtood in the Relation of a <hi>Paſtor</hi> to you, I wrote my Book of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> aiming therein more eſpecially at your benefit. Which <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> I hope (through the Lords bleſſing) hath been of ſome uſe to you. I have ſince thought that it would not be a ſervice unacceptable to you, to add by way of Supplement, a more full explication of the <hi>Main Principles</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and ſome <hi>Further Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections</hi> for regulating of your Practice, and to ſend them unto you to ſupply my <hi>Perſonal abſence.</hi> God only knows whether I ſhall ever ſee <hi>your Faces</hi> again in this World, <hi>Providence</hi> having fixed my Habitation at ſo great a diſtance from you. However <hi>my hearts deſire and prayer to God for you is, that you may be ſaved;</hi> and if this <hi>poor Book</hi> may in any meaſure contribute thereunto, I ſhall heartily rejoyce. The <hi>holy Apoſtles,</hi> no doubt, in writing <hi>their Epiſtles,</hi> aimed at the <hi>Spiritual good</hi> of the Church <hi>in general;</hi> yet we may well ſuppoſe that thoſe <hi>particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> to whom their <hi>Epiſtles</hi> were directed, read them with more eſpecial regard, and poſſibly reaped more <hi>ſignal benefits</hi> by them than <hi>others</hi> did. So, though I deſign theſe inſtructions for your Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good, and benefit of all thoſe into whoſe hands they ſhall come; Yet I hope they ſhall be more <hi>eſpecially minded</hi> and <hi>regarded</hi> by <hi>you</hi> to whom they are <hi>particularly directed,</hi> and in <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of whoſe neceſſities,</hi> and with <hi>an aim at whoſe benefit</hi> they were particularly framed. I know many of you are ſuch of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, Heb. <hi>5.12. Who have need that one teach you the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God, and have need of milk and not of ſtrong meat.</hi> I ſhould be glad to have you all rightly inſtructed in the <hi>main fundamentals</hi> of Chriſtianity, and that not for
<pb facs="tcp:66289:3"/> 
               <hi>your ſakes</hi> only, but for <hi>my own,</hi> that I may <hi>give up my account with joy and not with grief.</hi> Heb. <hi>13.17.</hi> But yet I muſt tell you that it is not enough to ſave any of you, that you are of the <hi>true Religion,</hi> except you be true to it, and live agreeably thereunto. God hath indeed made <hi>ſufficient proviſion</hi> by the obedience and death of his Son to ſave Mankind. But you muſt earneſtly leg of God to inable you to do your part, which is, <hi>unfeignedly to repent of all your ſins, ſavingly to believe in Chriſt and to accept him for your Lord and Saviour, and to deliver up your ſouls to him, that you may be pardoned through the infinite merit of his active and paſſive obedience, and ſanctified by his Spirit, and inabled by his grace to lead a holy and good life.</hi> And as I earneſtly deſire you all to have an eſpecial care of your own Souls, ſo do I with ſome importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity intreat all, that are Parents or Maſters of Families among you, that they would take great care to inſtruct their children and ſervants in the main Principles of the Chriſtian Religion. I have often thought, that if ever real Piety and Chriſtianity flouriſh in <hi>England,</hi> more muſt he done by Parents and Maſters in inſtructing thoſe under their care than is now ordinarily done. I hope this ſhort Treatiſe (may with the bleſſing of God) ſomething aſſiſt and help you in performing that part of your duty. May the God of all grace lead you and guide you in ways of truth and holineſs and inable you to live in love and peace one with another. And though I ſhould never ſee you again in this life, yet may the <hi>Father of Mercies</hi> (through his infinite goodneſs) grant that I may meet your Souls in Heaven. This is the earneſt deſire and prayer of him who was once your unworthy Paſtor, and is ſtill your very lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and affectionate friend,</p>

                  <p>And He hath been pleaſed of His infinite Goodneſs, graciouſly to conſider our frame and weakneſs, and ſeeing our <hi>Natural light</hi> is not ſufficient to diſcover and find out <hi>what may be known</hi> of him, he hath vouchſafed in his <hi>Holy Word,</hi> to reveal and manifeſt <hi>himſelf,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God.</note> and his <hi>glorious Nature</hi> to us. And Firſt, He hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed himſelf to be a <hi>pure, ſimple, immaterial, inviſible Being,</hi> a <hi>Spirit</hi> of tranſcendent glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. not having any <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>corporcity,</hi> nor being <hi>compounded</hi> as <hi>bodies</hi> are. And therefore we ſhould not <hi>Picture</hi> him to our <hi>Eye-ſight,</hi> nor repreſent him to our <hi>Fancies,</hi> under any <hi>bodily ſhape,</hi> or <hi>figure</hi> whatſoever; but ſhould raiſe our apprehenſions to the <hi>higheſt</hi> and <hi>holyeſt,</hi> to the <hi>pureſt</hi> and moſt <hi>Spiritual</hi> conceptions of him that we can poſſible frame: We ſhould labour to ſee this <hi>inviſible God</hi> by the eye of Faith, and obſerve his power and efficacy working in all his Creatures. 'Tis <hi>He</hi> that <hi>enlightens</hi> us by the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>warms</hi> us by the <hi>fire,</hi> and makes our <hi>food</hi> to nouriſh us, and his other Creatures to do us good.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> ſay, There are <hi>Three ways</hi> of knowing God; Firſt, <hi>Per viam eminentiae,</hi> when we aſcribe all poſſible <hi>perfections</hi> to him. Secondly, <hi>Per viam negationis,</hi> when we remove from him all <hi>imperfections</hi> whatſoever. Thirdly, <hi>Per viam cauſationis,</hi> when we ſee, and acknowledge that all things that are made, are made by him, and receive their being, and all their powers, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is an <hi>infinite Being;</hi> for whatſoever hath <hi>no cauſe</hi> of being, can have no <hi>bounds</hi> or <hi>limits</hi> of being ſet to it. For the reaſon why <hi>any Being</hi> is bounded, limited, and confin'd to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66289:6"/> ſuch a <hi>meaſure</hi> and <hi>degree of Being</hi> only; is becauſe the <hi>Author</hi> of its exiſtence communicated and beſtowed only <hi>ſo much being, power</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> upon it, and no more. He that made it, ſet <hi>limits</hi> and <hi>bounds</hi> to it; that <hi>hitherto</hi> its Eſſence ſhould go and extend, and no further. All things that <hi>receive</hi> their <hi>Being,</hi> (as all things Created do) can have <hi>no more</hi> of <hi>being, life, power,</hi> or <hi>vertue,</hi> than is given them by the Author of their Nature.

                  <p n="3">III. God is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</note> Mat. 19.26. <hi>With God all things are poſſible.</hi> His <hi>Eſſence</hi> being <hi>infinite,</hi> his <hi>power</hi> muſt needs be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> alſo.

God cannot make <hi>contradictions</hi> true, he cannot <hi>lye,</hi> he cannot deny himſelf; for theſe things do not ſpeak perfection, but weakneſs. <hi>Convenientius dicitur ea non poſſe fieri, quam quod Deus ea non poſſet facere,</hi> ſays <hi>Aquinas</hi> warily; 'Tis more convenient to ſay, That theſe things cannot be done, than that God cannot do them. Now Gods <hi>Omnipotency</hi> ſhould make theſe <hi>impreſſions</hi> on us,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We ſhould ſtand in fear, and tremble at his Judgments. <hi>Shall the Lyon roar, and ſhall not the Beaſts of the Field tremble?</hi> Shall <hi>Omnipotency</hi> ſhake his Rod over us, and ſhall not we humble our ſelves? The <hi>dread</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly Majeſty,</hi> of his infinite greatneſs and power, ſhould be ſtill upon us. Indeed, we ſhould not be under a ſlaviſh fear of God (that is void of love) as men fear an Enemy; but we ſhould fear ſinning againſt, or diſpleaſing ſo great a God. <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdom, Prov.</hi> 16.6, <hi>By it men depart from evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:66289:8"/>
                  <p>Secondly, We may ſee from hence what ground we have earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſeek unto him in all our difficulties and diſtreſſes. The ground of all the Petitions in the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> is this, <hi>For thine is the Kingdom, Power and Glory.</hi> Let the Enemies of the Church be never ſo ſtrong, God is ſtronger than they. He has promiſed that <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt his Church, Mat.</hi> 16.18. Nothing encourages more to fervent Prayer, than a due ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Gods <hi>Omnipotence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This <hi>Attribute</hi> ſhould imprint upon our hearts a <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>ſtedfaſt confidence</hi> in God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. <hi>They that know thy Name will truſt in thee.</hi> O what an encouragement is it to the Saints, that they have <hi>Omnipotence</hi> engaged for them! O what a ſhame is it that ever we ſhould diſtruſt an Almighty God. He can ſupply our greateſt wants; He can mitigate or remove our greateſt pains; He can deliver us from our greateſt diſtreſſes. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.17. What will vain man have confidence in, if he diſtruſt <hi>Omnipotence?</hi> Where can we be ſafe, if not in the hands of the Almighty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Why fear ye,</hi> (ſays our Saviour to his Apoſtles) <hi>O ye of little Faith.</hi> Remember O Chriſtian in thy loweſt eſtate, and in the Churches greateſt dangers, the <hi>Almighty</hi> is able to raiſe his <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>thee</hi> again, even in a moment. Take heed of ſaying in thy heart, <hi>Can God furniſh a Table in the Wilderneſs? Pſal.</hi> 78.19. Read and conſider theſe Scriptures, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.25. <hi>The fear of man bringeth a ſnare, but who-ſo putteth his truſt in the Lord, ſhall be ſafe. Pſal.</hi> 56.3, 4. <hi>What time I am afraid, I will truſt in thee. In God I have put my truſt; I will not fear what Fleſh can do unto me.</hi> Jer. 17.5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and maketh Fleſh his Arm; and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Gods <hi>Almightineſs</hi> ſhould poſſeſs us with a holy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of him, and cauſe us in <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>voice</hi> to magnifie him. O what a <hi>power is that</hi> which made the World of nothing, which hangs the Earth in the Air, and upholds it without any Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What a <hi>power is that</hi> which <hi>ſtretcheth out the Heavens as a Curtain,</hi> and hath ſo beſpangled with Stars that glorious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy.</p>
                  <p>What a <hi>power is that,</hi> which at firſt <hi>placed,</hi> and ſince <hi>maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> all things in their Order; which cauſeth every part of Nature to do its Office; which maketh the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> conſtantly to keep
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66289:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> their courſe? <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.35. <hi>The Lord giveth the Sun for a light by day, and the Ordinances of the Moon, and of the Stars for a light by night. He divideth the Sea, when the waves thereof do roar; the Lord of Hoſts is his Name.</hi> Iſa. 4.22. <hi>It is he that ſitteth upon the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Earth, and the inhabitants there of are as Graſhoppers; it is he that ſtretcheth out the Heavens as a Curtain, and ſpreadeth them out as a Tent to dwell in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, God's <hi>Almightineſs</hi> ſhould be a great comfort and ſupport to all that have an intereſt in him. Wo to thoſe the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is againſt; but happy, thrice happy are they, that have the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their refuge.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Gods is <hi>Omniſcient,</hi>

He is ſaid to <hi>ſee the reins, and the heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if God be <hi>Omniſcient,</hi> how watchfully and carefully ſhould we carry our ſelves in all places? How ſhould we fear to ſin in <hi>ſecret</hi> againſt him whoſe eye is always upon us? How <hi>ſincere</hi> and upright ſhould we be in all our duties?

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We ſhould take heed of <hi>truſting in our own wiſdom. The way of man is not in himſelf, Jer.</hi> 10.23.

                     </label> Firſt, No man is <hi>perfectly Righteous</hi> here; therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if Gods own Children have the Rod ſometimes upon their backs, for their ſins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God may tenderly <hi>love</hi> his Children, though he do afflict them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>For whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth.</hi> Pſal. 119.57. <hi>I know O Lord that thy Judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulneſs haſt afflicted me.</hi> God ſanctifies the afflictions of his People to their good. Their afflictions are profitable unto them for the <hi>encreaſe</hi> of their <hi>Graces,</hi> and ſo for the furtherance of their glory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They have good aſſurance that <hi>all things ſhall work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for their good, Rom.</hi> 8.28. And therefore no cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Though godlineſs <hi>hath the promiſes of this life, as well as of that to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. Yet thoſe promiſes of Temporal
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66289:10"/> bleſſings muſt be underſtood with this <hi>limitation,</hi> viz. That they ſhall be made good to them, ſo far forth as God ſhall ſee it <hi>good</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> for his Children in this life, and no further.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The <hi>proſperity</hi> of wicked men in this World is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways very <hi>hurtfull,</hi> and extremely diſadvantagious to them, in reference to their Eternal condition. <hi>Outward ſufferings</hi> with <hi>Spiritual bleſſings</hi> are ordinarily the Lot of Gods Children here on Earth, as <hi>outward proſperity</hi> with Spiritual calamity is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Lot of the ungodly. <hi>The proſperity of fools deſtroys them,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 1.32.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, There will be a day of Judgment wherein all things will be ſet right, though here things oftentimes ſeem to be out of courſe.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Eternity is long enough to <hi>puniſh</hi> the <hi>wicked,</hi> and <hi>reward the Godly;</hi> therefore let us not take our meaſures either of <hi>happineſs</hi> or <hi>miſery,</hi> from the outward diſpenſations of this life.</p>
                  <p>The Conſideration of <hi>this Attribute</hi> ſhould make theſe <hi>impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> upon us,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if God be <hi>juſt,</hi> then this ſhould make all impenitent ſinners tremble. Except men <hi>repent,</hi> 'tis not conſiſtent with Gods juſtice, they ſhould be pardoned. What great cauſe have ungodly impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinners to tremble at the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, which engages him to deal ſo ſeverely with them, and to puniſh them everlaſtingly as his Enemies. O wretched ſinner what aileth thee to make this <hi>juſt God</hi> thine enemy! What folly? What madneſs poſſeſſes thee that thou ſhouldſt make <hi>a mock at ſin,</hi> and laugh at Hell and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Shall not the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God terrifie thee, and keep thee off from thoſe ſinfull courſes which expoſe thee to ſo certain a vengeance?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods <hi>Juſtice,</hi> is a great conſolation to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. He will <hi>juſtifie</hi> them whom his <hi>Goſpel</hi> juſtifies, becauſe <hi>he is juſt,</hi> 1 John. 1.9. If thou <hi>break off thy ſins by repentance,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thy ſelf to Him for pardon; <hi>in</hi> and <hi>through the merits of his Son;</hi> He is <hi>juſt,</hi> and therefore will make good his promiſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God being <hi>juſt;</hi> let us bleſs his name for finding out a way whereby <hi>his Juſtice</hi> may be ſatisfied; and ſo we poor ſinners pardoned. His Juſtice might have taken every one of us by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66289:11"/> Throat, and ſaid, <hi>Pay all thou oweſt;</hi> and then what ſhould we have done? We could not have payed one Farthing of the Debt. O let us for ever bleſs his Holy Name, that he hath provided ſo good a <hi>ſurety</hi> for us; who hath undertaken the payment of our Debt; and to ſatisfie his juſtice, in our behalf.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Let us labour to <hi>imitate</hi> God in this Attribute of his Juſtice; that is, let us give to every one what of right is due to him. Let us labour to give to <hi>God</hi> his <hi>due;</hi> and to man his <hi>due.</hi> Let us not rob God of <hi>his time</hi> allotted for his ſervice. Let us give him our <hi>Hearts,</hi> and ſerve him with the beſt of our affections. Let us give to <hi>man</hi> what is due to him, not injuring any man <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and willingly.</hi> And in caſe of wrong done, let us labour to make ſatisfaction. <hi>Non remittitur peccatum niſi reſtituatur ablatum.</hi> Remember, that the ſin is notre mitted except that which is taken away wrongfully be reſtored.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. God is <hi>Mercifull.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mercifull.</note> He is called, <hi>The Father of Mercies,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3. <hi>Abundant in Mercy,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.3. <hi>Rich in Mercy,</hi> Eph. 2.4. And ſayes the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 145.8, 9. <hi>The Lord is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and full of compaſſion, ſlow to anger and of great mercy. The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the Attributes of God are <hi>glorious;</hi> yet, he rejoyceth moſt in the manifeſtation of his mercy and goodneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18, 19. When <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired the Lord to ſhew him his glory; He ſaid, <hi>I will make all my goodneſs paſs before thee, and I will proclaim the Name of the Lord before thee: and will be gracious to whom I will be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and will ſhew mercy to whom I will ſhew mercy.</hi> Iſai. 63.7. <hi>I will mention the loving kindneſſes of the Lord, and the praiſes of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath beſtowed upon us; and the great goodneſs toward the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which he hath beſtowed on them, according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving kindneſſes.</hi> He delights not in the death of a ſinner. His mercy is ſo great to all, that he will deſtroy none, but for their wilfull ſin.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of <hi>this Attribute</hi> ſhould teach us theſe Leſſons,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Gods mercy ſhould lead ſinners to repentance. It ſhould ſhame them from their ſins. It ſhould <hi>encourage</hi> them to repent, as well as <hi>engage</hi> them to it. O ſinners remember we have to do with a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66289:11"/> mercifull God, who hath not forbid any to come in, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to invite them, who have often refuſed, and will undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly welcome, and pardon all that will return and come in. But <hi>mercy it ſelf</hi> will have no mercy on the Impenitent, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27.11. <hi>It is a People of no underſtanding; therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them; and he that formed them, will ſhew them no favour. Wo</hi> to all them, againſt whom mercy it ſelf ſhall riſe up in Judgment; <hi>There is mercy with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared,</hi> ſayes the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 130.4. Were there no hope of pardon, <hi>Men</hi> would be as deſperate as the <hi>Devils</hi> themſelves. But God is merciful; He delighteth not in the death of a ſinner.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, The Mercy of God ſhould be the matter of our daily praiſes. The <hi>meditation</hi> of God's Mercy ſhould produce in us delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thoughts, and ſhould keep (as it were) a continual ſweetneſs upon our hearts, and cauſe us to ſtudy the moſt gratefull returns unto God. They that live continually upon Mercy, ſhould be as it were turned into love and thankfullneſs. It ſhould become as it were their <hi>Nature,</hi> and Conſtitution, as the <hi>food</hi> men live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be ſeen in their <hi>Temperature,</hi> health and ſtrength. O how unſpeakable is the Mercy of God, that provides ſo well for his Servants in this their Warfare and Pilgrimage through this World!

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66289:12"/> But eſpecially, if God hath touched our hearts with his ſaving <hi>grace,</hi> if he hath effectually called us, and inabled us to repent of our ſins, and believe in his Son? O then how ſhould we bow down our heads, and adore his <hi>free grace,</hi> as the cauſe thereof.

Moſt certainly the prevailing love of God is the ſureſt evidence of true ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He that hath moſt love, has moſt grace. And if you tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love God you will be loath to offend him. The love of God doth not reign in that ſoul where the love of the <hi>World,</hi> or of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> or <hi>Pleaſure</hi> reigneth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Mercy</hi> of God ſhould teach us to imitate him in <hi>this Attribute.</hi> We ſhould labour <hi>to be mercifull, as our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father is mercifull;</hi> that is, as <hi>to the manner,</hi> though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach to the <hi>meaſure.</hi> The goodneſs of God ſhould poſſeſs us with a deſire to be conformed to his goodneſs <hi>in our meaſure.

And <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. <hi>God is not a man that he ſhould lye.</hi> God hath promiſed to them that <hi>repent,</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> in his Son that they ſhall be ſaved. He hath promiſed to give <hi>his Holy Spirit to them that ask him, Luk.</hi> 11, 9. And we have reaſon firmly to believe theſe promiſes. As for <hi>Temporal things,</hi> he hath not promiſed <hi>them</hi> to any of his Children <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but with a tacit condition; if he, in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom, ſee it <hi>good</hi> and <hi>expedient</hi> for them. So that <hi>as to theſe,</hi> we muſt humbly refer our ſelves to his infinite Wiſdom. 'Tis true, we are required to <hi>pray</hi> for theſe <hi>Temporal</hi> things <hi>in faith;</hi> but not with an aſſured particular perſwaſion, that God will give us <hi>the very particular things</hi> we ask, but with a <hi>faith of dependance</hi> on God, and ſubmiſſion to his Holy will. When we act faith on the <hi>All-ſufficiency</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God, and humbly reſign our ſelves to his Holy will, we may be ſaid to <hi>pray in faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to the Leſſons which we are to learn from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of <hi>this Attribute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, We ſhould learn from hence, that the commands of God are ſerious, and his <hi>promiſes</hi> and threatnings will certainly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. There is nothing of reaſon or ſence can be ſpoken againſt an Holy life by any one who believes the veracity and <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> of God, and the <hi>truth</hi> of his Word. Hath God ſaid
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66289:13"/> (and do you believe it) that he will <hi>come in flaming Fire to take vengeance on all them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8. And can you continue in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and diſobedience? Hath he ſaid that <hi>the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. And can you continue in unrighteouſn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſs? Hath he ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord;</hi> and can you ſlight Holineſs? And mock at ſerious Piety? If you believ'd God to be faithfull and his Word true, how could theſe things be ſo?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods faithfulneſs is a great aggravation of the <hi>hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs</hi> of the ſin of <hi>unbelief. He that believeth not God, hath made him a lyer,</hi> faith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. And this is the rather to be heeded, that we may ſtir up in our ſelves a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>watchfulneſs</hi> againſt <hi>this ſin,</hi> which with many is accounted but a meer <hi>infirmity.</hi> O what matter of <hi>humiliation</hi> doth our <hi>proneneſs</hi> to this ſin, (namely to diſtruſt God) juſtly miniſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us? Many men hardly truſt the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God ſo much as they would the word of a mortal man, whom they account <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>juſt.</hi> Certainly Gods <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> ſhould teach us to hate every motion to unbelief. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> is the very <hi>bane</hi> of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſo far as it prevails. Let it be our great care therefore to extirpate all remainders of this ſin of Infidelity out of our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If God be <hi>faithful,</hi> this ſhould be a great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us to <hi>truſt in him,</hi> and in his <hi>promiſes.</hi> It ſhould be the ſolid ground of our <hi>faith,</hi> the <hi>ſtay</hi> of our Souls, the <hi>foundation</hi> of all our hopes. <hi>Faith</hi> is animated by Gods <hi>veracity</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> and from thence all other graces are excited in us. O <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> what <hi>life</hi> ſhould it put into our hopes to think that all thoſe <hi>words</hi> that God hath ſpoken are moſt certainly <hi>true;</hi> that all thoſe deſcriptions of the <hi>everlaſting Kingdom,</hi> all thoſe exceeding <hi>precious promiſes,</hi> that concern <hi>this life,</hi> or <hi>that which is to come,</hi> will certainly be made good; that all thoſe expreſſions of the exceeding <hi>love</hi> of God to his poor Servants, are <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>ſure.</hi> O how ſhould our <hi>faith</hi> live upon this <hi>truth</hi> of God, and by it be daily more and more ſtrengthened! And particularly that none of his promiſes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Church,</hi> will fail or fall to the ground.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, How <hi>thankfull</hi> ſhould we be to God for giving us ſuch <hi>gracious promiſes</hi> to encourage us in the ways of our obedience. He has promiſed that <hi>he will never, never</hi> leave nor forſake thoſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66289:13"/> that are in Covenant with him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. We have good aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>That all things ſhall work together for good, to them that love God.</hi> Rom. 8.28. <hi>That he will give grace and glory and no good thing will he with-hold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſal. 84.11. And what can we deſire more?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We ſhould labour to get an <hi>intereſt Chriſt,</hi> in whom <hi>all the promiſes of God are Yea and Amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. That is, have their <hi>foundation, firm eſtabliſhment</hi> and <hi>unalterable ratification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, We ſhould learn the <hi>Divine art</hi> of <hi>living upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God,</hi> and fetching <hi>comfort,</hi> for the ſupport of our lives from them. Moſt men live on their <hi>preſent enjoyments,</hi> not on Gods <hi>promiſes.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Prophet</hi> tells us, <hi>Habak.</hi> 2.4. <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by his Faith.</hi> Certainly nothing makes us ſo <hi>humble, lowly;</hi> and puts us into ſo much <hi>eaſe,</hi> and <hi>quietneſs</hi> of mind, as to <hi>live by Faith</hi> on God. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26.3. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whoſe mind is ſtay'd on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> of God ſhould engage us to be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>faithfull</hi> to him. Have we not ingaged in our <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> to <hi>forſake the Devil, the World and the Fleſh;</hi> and to devote our ſelves to the ſincere ſervice and worſhip of God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt? <hi>Are not his Vows upon us? that is,</hi> Vows to ſerve him faithfully, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.12. And ſhall we be like thoſe falſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of whom 'tis ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.36, 37. <hi>Nevertheleſs they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their Tongues. For their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſteadfaſt in his Covenant.</hi> And have we not in the courſe of our lives made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>particular promiſes</hi> to God in our particular diſtreſſes? And ſhall we expect that God ſhould perform <hi>his promiſes</hi> to us, when we take no care to perform <hi>ours</hi> to him? Shall we expect that God will perform his promiſe of pardon to us, when we take no care to perform the <hi>conditions</hi> required of us; upon the performance of <hi>which,</hi> we may comfortly expect to have the Divine promiſes made good to us?</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, We ſhould endeavour to <hi>imitate</hi> God in this Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of his <hi>faithfulneſs.</hi> Let us be <hi>true</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>true</hi> alſo to <hi>man.</hi> Remember you ſerve <hi>a God of truth;</hi> and 'tis the glory of his ſervants to be <hi>like</hi> him. The Devil indeed is the <hi>Father of lyes;</hi> but God hates all <hi>lying,</hi> as contrary to his <hi>Holy Nature.</hi> If you would be <hi>like</hi> God, labour to imitate him in his <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs.</hi>

                  <p>TO prevent all <hi>miſapprehenſions</hi> concerning <hi>God</hi> and <hi>the Divine Nature,</hi> it will be requiſite that we carefully attend unto the <hi>Declaration</hi> or <hi>Revelation</hi> that <hi>God</hi> hath been pleaſed to make of <hi>himſelf</hi> in the Holy Scriptures. For ſurely we have all the reaſon in the World to aſſent to thoſe <hi>aſſertions</hi> or <hi>teſtimonies</hi> that God is pleaſed to give unto us concerning himſelf, and that according to their <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>genuine ſence.</hi> The <hi>Sum</hi> then of this <hi>Revelation</hi> held forth to us in Holy Scriptures, is this, That God is one: That this <hi>one God</hi> is <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> That the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is the <hi>Father of the Son,</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>Son of the Father;</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> the <hi>Spirit of the Father</hi> and the <hi>Son;</hi> and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their <hi>mutual reſpects</hi> and <hi>relations</hi> to each other, and <hi>their peculiar properties</hi> ariſing from thoſe particular relations, they (<hi>viz. Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>) are <hi>diſtinct</hi> each from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>one God</hi> is ſet forth to us in the Scriptures as the <hi>only true God,</hi> whom we are to <hi>believe in, adore, worſhip</hi> and <hi>obey.</hi> This is the <hi>firſt cauſe, Soveraign Lord,</hi> and <hi>ultimate end</hi> of all. For the proof hereof, we ſhall produce <hi>Divine Teſtimonies</hi> whereon <hi>Faith</hi> may ſafely reſt.

And ſurely if <hi>Miniſters</hi> may not ſet forth the <hi>ſence</hi> of the words of Scripture in ſuch <hi>expreſſions</hi> as they apprehend do moſt clearly convey the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>genuine meaning</hi> of them to the People, to what end ſerves that <hi>great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:66289:14"/> of preaching the Word? I ſhall begin therefore with the <hi>Original Revelation,</hi> and ſhew you what is delivered to us by Divine Teſtimony; and <hi>this</hi> I ſhall give you in theſe particulars fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> We are aſſured by Divine Revelation that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>one. Deut.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Hear O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the Lord our God is one Lord.</hi> Iſai. 44.6.8. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the King of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and his Redeemer the Lord of Hoſts, I am the firſt, and I am the laſt, and beſides me there is no God. Is there any God beſides me? Yea, there is no God, I know not any.</hi> Iſai. 45.5. I am the Lord, and there is none elſe, there is no God beſides me, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. <hi>As concerning therefore the eating of things Offered in Sacrifice unto Idols, we know that an Idol is nothing in the World, and that there is none other God but one.</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Father</hi> is God. He is often <hi>ſo called,</hi> only in reference to his <hi>Son.</hi> And if he had an <hi>eternal Son;</hi> (as we ſhall prove preſently) He is <hi>an Eternal Father,</hi> and his <hi>Paternity</hi> was from Eternity co-exiſtent with his Deity.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Eternal Son</hi> of God, and did prae-exiſt in the <hi>form</hi> or <hi>Eſſence</hi> of God (having all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Deity) <hi>before his Incarnation,</hi> which was effected by <hi>voluntary actings</hi> of his own, which could not be without a <hi>prae-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence</hi> in another Nature.

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us conſider this, All the <hi>ways</hi> whereby we can come to know God are either by his <hi>Name,</hi> or his <hi>Properties,</hi> or his <hi>Works,</hi> or the <hi>Divine worſhip</hi> given unto him. Now all theſe belong to the <hi>Son. He</hi> therefore is <hi>God,</hi> or we cannot tell either <hi>who,</hi> or <hi>what</hi> God is. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The <hi>proper Name</hi> of God <hi>(viz. Jehovah)</hi> is given to Him, Jer. 23.6. <hi>This is his Name whereby he ſhall be called, The Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. He is called <hi>The moſt high God, who is over all, God bleſſed for evermore.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">A Title <hi>peculiar to the</hi> moſt high God.</note>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Divine Properties</hi> are aſcribed to him, and ſuch <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine excellencies</hi> as naturally and neceſſarily appertain to the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> Particularly theſe Four,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, Eternity,</hi> Joh. 1.1, 2. <hi>In the beginning was the Word.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Omnipreſence,</hi> Mat. 18.20. <hi>Where two or three are met together in my Name</hi> (ſays our Saviour,) <hi>there am I in the midſt of them,</hi> viz. By my Eternal Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.13. <hi>No man hath aſcended up to Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of man, which is in Heaven.</hi> And Mat. 28.20. <hi>And ſo I am with you always even to the end of the World.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Omnipotency.</hi> Philip. 3.8. 'Tis ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>that He ſhall change our vile bodies, and make them like to his own glorious body, according to the mighty working whereby He is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf.</hi> Joh. 1.3. <hi>All things were made by him and without him was not any thing made, that was made,</hi> Heb. 1.10. <hi>And thou Lord in the beginning haſt laid the Foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the works of thine hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, Omniſcience.</hi> Joh. 21.17. <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all things,</hi> ſays <hi>Peter.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.25. 'Tis ſaid of our Saviour, that <hi>He

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Divine <hi>actions</hi> or <hi>works</hi> are aſcribed to him. As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Creation,</hi> Joh. 1.3. <hi>All things were made by him.</hi> So that there muſt needs be granted unto Chriſt a <hi>prae-exiſtence</hi> in his Divine Nature <hi>antecedent</hi> to his Incarnation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Providence,</hi> Heb. 1.3. <hi>He upholdeth all things by the Word of his power,</hi> And <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17. <hi>He is before all things and by him all things conſiſt.</hi> He is not only before all Creatures, and their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but together (with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt) their Up-holder, powerfull Preſerver and Governour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, Divine Worſhip</hi> is given to him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> themſelves refuſed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Worſhip,</hi> Rev. 19.10. <hi>See thou do it not</hi> (ſays the <hi>Angel</hi> there) that is, <hi>See thou do not worſhip me, I am thy fellow</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. <hi>You believe in God</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>believe alſo in me.</hi> Now to be <hi>believed in, and reſted on,</hi> is an <hi>honour</hi> or <hi>homage</hi> peculiar unto God alone. Indeed the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay that though Chriſt be not the <hi>moſt High God;</hi> yet, he ought to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Religious worſhip.</hi> But ſurely they do not well conſider, that only <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Eſſential excellencies</hi> are the <hi>formal Object</hi> of Divine and Religious worſhip, and to give ſuch a worſhip to one that is not God <hi>by Nature,</hi> is plain Idolatry. Where the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is, there is the <hi>true, proper, formal Object</hi> of Religious worſhip; and where <hi>that</hi> is not, it is <hi>Idolatry</hi> to aſcribe it <hi>to,</hi> or exerciſe it <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> any other. So that if the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of God be able to decide a <hi>difference</hi> among the Children of men, I ſee not but that the Teſtimony given to the <hi>God-head</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> are as <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>unqueſtionable</hi> as thoſe which are given concerning the <hi>Deity</hi> of the <hi>Father.</hi> And thus we have ſpoken to the Third thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is delivered to us by Divine Revelation that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is God. This will plainly appear if we conſider what is revealed to us concerning the <hi>Divine exiſtence, the Divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Operations</hi> of this bleſſed Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Such things are aſcribed to him in the Scriptures which do <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlably</hi> evidence him to be a <hi>voluntary Divine Agent,</hi> an <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Divine exiſting ſubſtance,</hi> a <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>intelligent ſubſiſtence,</hi> the Author of <hi>Divine Operations,</hi> and the <hi>Object</hi> of Divine and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66289:17"/> worſhip. There are ſome that hold he is a <hi>meer emanation</hi> of virtue or power from God and not a <hi>Perſon.</hi> Others grant indeed <hi>his Perſonality,</hi> and that he is a <hi>diſtinct ſelf-ſubſiſting Perſon,</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his <hi>Deity;</hi> they deny him to be a <hi>participant</hi> of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> A <hi>Created, finite Spirit</hi> they will allow him to be, and the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> of all Spirits that were created, and the <hi>Head</hi> of all the good Angels. But they will not allow him to be a <hi>Divine Perſon.</hi> We ſhall therefore endeavour to prove from plain Teſtimonies of Scripture,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he is not a meer emanation of virtue or power from God, but an <hi>intelligent ſubſiſtence,</hi> or <hi>Perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A <hi>Divine Perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Perſon <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the Father and the Son.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A Perſon proceeding from the Father and the Son.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It will appear, he is a Perſon becauſe he is endued with <hi>Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal properties, and Perſonal actions</hi> (ſuch as are peculiar and proper to a perſon) are Attributed to him. As namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To make interceſſion.</hi> Rom. 8.26. <hi>The Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities. For we know not how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit maketh interceſſion for us,</hi> v. 27. <hi>And he that ſearcheth the hearts, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is the mind of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God.</hi>

Thus the Father <hi>gives, ſends, commands</hi> the <hi>Son, he</hi> having <hi>condeſcended</hi> to take our Nature on him, and to be <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and man.

                     </note> Yet all their actings <hi>ad extra</hi> towards the Creatures, being the actings of God, are <hi>undivided,</hi> and are all the works of one and the ſame God,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Each Perſon hath its own <hi>ſubſtance;</hi> for the <hi>one ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> is the ſubſtance of <hi>each Perſon,</hi> and ſo is ſtill but <hi>one.</hi> But each Perſon hath not its <hi>own diſtinct ſubſtance (ſeparate</hi> from the ſubſtance of the other Perſons) becauſe the ſubſtance of them all is the <hi>ſame.</hi> Where therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the <hi>Son</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> from the Father, (or from <hi>God</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Perſonally</hi> as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) it argues not in the leaſt, that he is not <hi>partaker of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature</hi> with him. 'Tis true, in one Eſſence there can be but one Perſon, where the ſubſtance is finite and limited, but it hath no place in that which is <hi>infinite.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Each Perſon is <hi>infinite</hi> as he is <hi>God.</hi> For all <hi>Divine Properties</hi> belong not to the <hi>Perſons</hi> on the account of their <hi>Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,</hi> but on the account of their <hi>Divine Nature</hi> which is <hi>one;</hi> for they are all Natural Properties. And therefore as the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of each Perſon is infinite, ſo is <hi>each Perſon</hi> becauſe of that <hi>Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>only true God</hi> is Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. But when we ſay the <hi>Father</hi> is the <hi>only true God,</hi> we reſpect not his <hi>Paternity,</hi> or <hi>Paternal relation</hi> to his Son, but his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> Eſſence, or Being. And the like may be ſaid of the <hi>Son,</hi> that <hi>He</hi> is the <hi>onely true God;</hi> and ſo of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> For the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> though <hi>abſolutely ſingular</hi> and <hi>one,</hi> yet is communicated to <hi>more,</hi> and hath a larger ſignification then either the Term <hi>Father, Son,</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So that though <hi>each Perſon</hi> be the only true God, it does not follow that <hi>one Perſon</hi> muſt be <hi>another;</hi> namely, <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> muſt be the <hi>Son,</hi> or the <hi>Son</hi> the <hi>Father.</hi> For though the Father be the <hi>only true God,</hi> yet it does not follow that every one who is the <hi>true God</hi> is the <hi>Father.</hi> For the <hi>Son</hi> is the only true God, and ſo is the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe they are equally <hi>participant</hi> of the Divine Nature. But to ſay, <hi>whoever</hi> is the only true God is the <hi>Father,</hi> is falſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, Diſtinction,</hi> and <hi>inequality</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Office,</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> does not in the leaſt take away <hi>equality</hi> and <hi>ſameneſs</hi> with the Father in reſpect of Nature, and Eſſence, Phi. 2.6, 7, 8. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God; yet made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of men. And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi>

                  <p>

The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> knew Chriſt to be the <hi>Eternal Son</hi> of God (which is a part of this Myſtery of the Trinity) and our Saviour tells him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16, 17. <hi>That Fleſh and Blood had not revealed it unto him, but his Father.</hi> A man ought not preſently to deſert his perſwaſion <hi>grounded upon Scripture,</hi> becauſe he cannot anſwer every Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the <hi>ſubtil Wit</hi> of man can make againſt it.

And it will not be amiſs to give my Reader theſe two further directions.

                  <p>And having given this hint or admonition (which I think very needfull at this time) let me in the cloſing up of this Diſcourſe adviſe all thoſe that have any true deſire to walk in the narrow path of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> (which leads to everlaſting bliſs) to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the firſt place <hi>judiciouſly</hi> to underſtand this Sacred Doctrine according to the Original Revelation thereof, made in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.

                  <p>Firſt, Their <hi>Number.</hi> The Scripture teaches us that they are <hi>very many,</hi> Dan. 7.10. <hi>A fiery ſtream iſſued and came forth from before him, Thouſand Thouſands miniſtred unto him, and Ten Thouſand times Ten Thouſands ſtood before him; the Judgment was ſet and the Book was opened.</hi> Rev. 5 11. <hi>And I beheld and heard the voice of many Angels round about the Throne and the Beaſts, and the Elders, and the Number of them was Ten Thouſand times Ten Thouſand, and Thouſands of Thouſands.</hi> Matth. 26.53. <hi>Thinkeſt thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he ſhall preſently ſend me more then Twelve Legions of Angels.</hi> Heb. 12.22. <hi>But ye are now come unto Mount</hi> Sion <hi>and unto the City of the living God, the Heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of Angels.</hi> Pſal. 68.17. <hi>The Chariots of God are Twenty Thouſand, even Thouſands of Angels;</hi> 2 Kings 6.17. <hi>And</hi> Eliſha <hi>prayed, and the Lord opened the Eyes of the young man, and he ſaw the Mountain was full of Horſes, and Chariots of Fire round about</hi> Eliſha; that is, that a great multitude of Angels were ſent from God to defend and protect the Prophet.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes <hi>Sons of God,</hi> Job. 38.7. <hi>When the morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes, <hi>Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers,</hi> as we read, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. And ſo much of their <hi>Titles.</hi>

As at Chriſt's Sepulchre there appeared <hi>two Angels</hi> in <hi>white,</hi> the one ſitting at the Head, the other at the Feet, where the body of Jeſus had lain, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.12.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. They attend his glorious preſence. They are his chief Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and principal attendants, the bright Courtiers of Heaven.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are eſpeciall Inſtruments to praiſe and magnifie him. Rev. 7.11, 12. <hi>And all the Angels ſtoood round about the Throne and fell before the Throne on their faces and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. They are Meſſengers to carry and reveal his mind and will. By the glorious miniſtry and proclamation of Angels, God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his Law on Mount <hi>Sinai. Act.</hi> 7.53. Compared with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. Chriſt the <hi>Head</hi> of Angels proclaimed his Law by the voice of an Angel, as a <hi>Herald</hi> in preſence of the King publiſhes his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66289:22"/> Proclamations. And ſo on ſundry other occaſions God uſed to make known his will by Angels, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.21. <hi>Whiles I was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in prayer,</hi> ſays <hi>Daniel, the man</hi> Gabriel, <hi>(whom I had ſeen in the Viſion at the beginning) being cauſed to fly ſwiftly, touched me about the time of the evening Oblation.</hi> And <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.11. <hi>There appeared unto</hi> Zacharias <hi>an Angel of the Lord, ſtanding on the right ſide of the Altar of Incenſe, and ſaid unto him, I am</hi> Gabriel, <hi>that ſtand in the preſence of God: And am ſent to ſpeak unto thee, and to ſhew thee theſe glad tidings.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 26. in the Sixth Month, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> was ſent from God, unto a City of <hi>Galilee</hi> name <hi>Nazareth</hi> to the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 2.9, 10. An Angel was ſent to the <hi>Shepherds</hi> keeping watch over their Flock, by Night to bring the joyful tidings of the Birth of the Meſſias.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are Miniſters to <hi>execute</hi> and <hi>perform</hi> what God will have done in the World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, ye his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that excel in ſtrength, that do his Comma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They ſtop <hi>Balaams</hi> courſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.22. They ſtop the <hi>Lyons</hi> Mouths, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.20, 22. They execute the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon wicked men. Thus we read how <hi>Two Angels</hi> deſtroyed <hi>Sodom;</hi> and that an Angel defeated the Hoſt of <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib,</hi> 2 Kings 19.35. And that an Angel ſmote bloody perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting <hi>Herod,</hi> Acts 12.33.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of their Miniſtry in reference to God. I come now to conſider.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They prevent danger to him from <hi>Herod,</hi> Matth. 2.13, 14.

                     <p>The general and comprehenſive Name of <hi>evil Angels</hi> in the Scripture, is <hi>Devil [Diabolus,]</hi> wich ſignifies an accuſer or ſlanderer.</p>

                     <p>The greateſt evidence of the <hi>Nature</hi> of their ſin we find in that place of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. where he ſhews that a Perſon to be ordained ſhould not be a <hi>Novice, leſt being lifted up with Pride, he fall into Condemnation of the Devil;</hi> that is, be guilty of <hi>that ſin, viz.</hi> Pride, (which young men are ſo prone unto) for which the <hi>Devil</hi> was <hi>Condemned</hi> and rejected of God.</p>
                     <p>Pride therefore ſeems to be (as I may ſo ſpeak) the <hi>Original</hi> ſin of thoſe Apoſtate Angels. But <hi>envy, malice, ſlandering,</hi> &amp;c. are their <hi>actual</hi> ſins.</p>
                     <p>Yet what <hi>kind of pride</hi> it was, and <hi>how</hi> it diſcovered it ſelf; is not eaſie to determine. Whether it was an <hi>affectation</hi> to be as <hi>high</hi> as God himſelf, or a ſeeking to be <hi>higher</hi> than God had made them, is not eaſie to be reſolv'd. Certain it is the <hi>Temptation</hi> they ſpred before our <hi>firſt Parents</hi> was, <hi>ye ſhall be as Gods.</hi> Or whether they refuſed the <hi>Work, Office, and Miniſtration</hi> God deſign'd them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in reference to <hi>Men.</hi> Or whether it was too great a <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>glorying</hi> in their own <hi>gifts,</hi> and <hi>received</hi> excellencies; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was an <hi>affectation of Worſhip</hi> from men, (as we ſee they now delight in it) or whether it was any other Rebellion againſt Gods Majeſty and Empire, 'tis hard to determine.

That knowledge is proper to God, and accordingly he challengeth it unto himſelf, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 41.23. <hi>Shew things that are to come hereafter, that we may know ye are gods,</hi> ſays he, of the <hi>vanities</hi> and <hi>Idols</hi> of the Heathen. They are of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>ſagacity</hi> to judge of mens <hi>hearts</hi> by their outward geſtures, and carriage. In a word they are wiſe enough to <hi>do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Their <hi>malice</hi> is very great. This is ſet forth to the life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Be ſober, be vigilant, becauſe your adverſary the Devil like a roaring Lyon goes about ſeeking whom he may devour, whom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſtedfaſt in the Faith.</hi> His malice is ſo great, that he goes about doing miſchief, though he knowes that he gets no good by it; nay though his puniſhment will be ſo much the greater, for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief he does.</p>
                     <p>His malice is great againſt <hi>all mankind,</hi> but principally againſt the

                        <hi>Saints,</hi> and Servants of God. Firſt, Becauſe they bear the Image of God.

                     <p n="3">3. They are Spirits of <hi>great Power,</hi> though it be limited by God, ſo that it cannot be exerciſed, but <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>where,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> it pleaſeth him. The Devil doth exerciſe his power as far as he is able to the <hi>hurt</hi> of the Children of men, but eſpecially to the hurt of the <hi>Saints</hi> obſtinately endeavouring to hinder them from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying <hi>that happineſs</hi> which <hi>he</hi> loſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They are Spirits of great <hi>induſtry</hi> to do miſchief as we may ſee <hi>Job</hi> 1.6.7. The Devil not only does all the outward miſchief he can, but he tempts alſo by <hi>inward ſuggeſtions.</hi> For being a <hi>Spirit,</hi> he hath communion with our <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> and can dart <hi>evil thoughts</hi> into us; thus he filled the heart of <hi>Judas</hi> to betray his Lord and Maſter.

And by an humble recourſe to Chriſt for help we ſhould labour to quench theſe fiery Darts. Our Saviour himſelf was tempted by the Devil to moſt hideous things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.

The Saints of God therefore ſhould encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage themſelves from theſe conſiderations,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A reſtraint is put on Satan in all his temptations. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. He cannot tempt further then God permits.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His temptations tend to the increaſe of their graces. Satans temptations increaſed <hi>Job</hi>'s patience, <hi>Paul</hi> by Satans buffeting was humbled, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They tend to promote the fervency of their prayers.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Their wiſdom and watchfulneſs will hereby be the more quickned.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. The reſiſting of theſe temptations ſhall tend to the increaſe of their glory hereafter.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Their <hi>preſent puniſhment</hi> may be conſidered, firſt, in reſpect of <hi>loſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Upon their ſin they fell from the place of <hi>happineſs,</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> which before they enjoyed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Neither was their place found any more in Heaven.</hi> Though that place in a <hi>myſtical ſence</hi> may ſpeak of the overthrowing of Satan in this preſent World, and caſting him out of the Church, yet here is a plain <hi>alluſion</hi> to Satans <hi>firſt fall</hi> from Heaven, as the ground of that expreſſion, and therefore it may ſerve as a proof in this matter. Their place of innocency was <hi>Heaven;</hi> they ſtood round about the Throne of God where the Angels do continually behold his face. Their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was to enjoy God, their duty to glorifie him. From this place they are now driven into the lower parts of the World as a place more fit for <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>miſery.</hi> Sometimes they fly up and down in the <hi>Air:</hi> therefore is Satan called the <hi>Prince of the Power of the Air,</hi> Eph. 2.3. And exerciſes the power that God permits him in the Regions of the Air, by raiſing Tempeſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes he <hi>compaſſeth the earth too and fro,</hi> Job. 1.7. And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. He is called <hi>the god of this World;</hi> that is, <hi>whom the World generally ſerves,</hi> and <hi>who</hi> by the juſt Judgment of God hath got ſuch a Dominion over Multitudes, that they ſerve him as their God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Their <hi>preſent puniſhment</hi> may be conſidered in reſpect of <hi>ſenſe.</hi> They are <hi>kept in Chains.</hi> That is,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They are under <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>horror</hi> of Conſcience. <hi>Cehennam ſuam ſecum portant.</hi> They carry their Hell about them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are under an utter deſpair of deliverance; to them there remaineth nothing but a <hi>certain looking for judgment and fiery indignation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Their <hi>malice, ſpight</hi> and <hi>power</hi> is curbed and bridled, and held in by the Almighty power of God, ſo that they cannot vent it as they would, which is no ſmall vexation to them. And thus much of their <hi>preſent puniſhment,</hi> both of loſs and ſenſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let us conſider their <hi>future puniſhment,</hi> which at the day of Judgment will be greater than now it is. They are not yet in that

                        <hi>Priſon</hi> and <hi>Place of torment</hi> where they ſhall abide for ever under the wrath of God. They are now entered into <hi>ſome degrees</hi> of Helliſh torments, but they are in expectation of <hi>greater.</hi> And therefore they cryed out to our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.31. <hi>Art thou come to torment us before our time?</hi> There is a time coming when the <hi>wrath of God</hi> ſhall be increaſed upon them. Hell <hi>is prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> Matth. 25.41. Though for the preſent they are under Gods <hi>wrath,</hi> yet they do not taſte the dregs of it. Therefore they beſought our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Luke 8.31. <hi>That he would not command them into the deep;</hi> that is, the place of <hi>full</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect torment.</hi>

If ſuch <hi>excellent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> fell, and fell do dreadfully, how ſhould <hi>we</hi> look to our ſelves?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let us obſerve the evil Nature of <hi>ſin,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>Pride.</hi> If <hi>Pride</hi> threw the Angels out of Heaven, and laid the foundation of Hell, we had need labour to maintain a great abhorrence in our hearts of <hi>that ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. We ſhould often conſider and it ſhould deeply affect us, that <hi>we</hi> loſt our <hi>firſt eſtate</hi> as well as the Angels, <hi>we</hi> loſt our Original ſtate of holineſs and happineſs as well as they.

                     <p n="8">8. Let us remember for our comfort that the Devil is in <hi>Chains.</hi> He had not power over an Herd of Swine without leave, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.31. So <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31. He could not <hi>ſift Peter</hi> till he had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.

                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Scripture</hi> clearly bears Teſtimony to it, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Shall there be evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Jer. 10.23. <hi>O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himſelf; it is not in man that walketh to direct his ſteps.</hi> Iſai. 45.7. <hi>I form the light, and create darkneſs: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all theſe things.</hi> Prov. 15.3. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</hi> James 4.15. <hi>For that ye ought to ſay, if the Lord will we ſhall live, and do this, and that,</hi> Job. 5.12. <hi>He diſapppointed the Devices of the crafty, ſo that their hands cannot perform their enterpriſe.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſon</hi> plainly ſhews it. There are ſeveral Arguments from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that may perſwade us to the belief hereof.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Natural inſtincts,</hi> that God hath put into <hi>unreaſonable</hi> Creatures which direct and move them, to do things very <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>rational,</hi> for their own preſervation, is another argument of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.6, 7, 8. <hi>Go to the Ant thou ſluggard, conſider her ways and be wiſe: which having no guide, Overſeer, or Ruler provideth her meat in the Summer, and gathereth her food in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.</hi> Jer. 8.7. <hi>Yea the Stork in the Heaven knoweth her appointed times, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow obſerve the time of their coming.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>ſuitable proviſion</hi> that God hath made for all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is another argument to prove a <hi>Providence.</hi> He provideth food for all,<note place="margin">Aves ſine Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio vivunt. <hi>Minut. Fael.</hi>
                        </note> and conveyeth it to them, in that quantity and Seaſon which is fitteſt for them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.15. <hi>The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou giveſt them their meat in due ſeaſon.</hi> Matth. 6.26. <hi>Behold the Fowls of the Air: for they ſow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into Barns; yet our Heavenly Father feedeth them.</hi> Pſal. 147.9. <hi>He giveth to the Beaſt his food, and to the young Ravens which cry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. It cannot conſiſt with the infinite <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> of God, not to <hi>preſide over</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> the World which he hath made. To conceive this <hi>great ſhip</hi> of the World to be left without a <hi>Pilot</hi> to govern it, and all things here below to be neglected, and ſuffered to run at <hi>random</hi> without any <hi>wiſe Agent</hi> to <hi>ſuperintend</hi> over them, and to order and regulate them, ſurely is very <hi>irrational.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Gods manifeſt appearing ſometimes in executing viſible
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66289:30"/> and remarkable puniſhments on <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>notorious</hi> ſinners: and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuing</hi> from their malice <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>good</hi> men, in anſwer to their prayers, is another argument of Providence, and muſt needs force impartial men to ſay, <hi>Doubtleſs there is a God, that ruleth, and judgeth in the Earth.</hi> The <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of all ages bear Teſtimony to this, ſo that I need not add any particular inſtances.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The reſtraining of the rage and power of <hi>Devils</hi> and infernal Spirits, and ſuch as are imployed by them, is another great and convincing argument of Divine Providence. Theſe Fiends of darkneſs and perdition are acted with extreme rage and fury againſt all that are good; and if God did not reſtrain them they would quickly pull the World about our ears. We could never be ſecure in our Houſes, or abroad one moment for them.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Events and <hi>iſſues</hi> very often are not correſpondent to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and intents of the contrivers. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> told his Brethren, Gen. 50.20. <hi>Ye thought evil againſt me, but God meant it for good.</hi> Who could have thought that <hi>Haman</hi> ſhould have been a means of advancing <hi>Mordecai?</hi> And yet ſo it came to paſs, what ever the World thinks, the actions of men and their <hi>ſucceſſes</hi> are under the Regiment and guidance of the Divine Will and Providence, that inviſibly governs and over-rules. Have we not often ſeen how in one moment a pitifull ſmall unexpected occurrence has broke in pieces a deſign laid with long deliberation, with huge proſpect and forecaſt of difficulties, and with great reſerves and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt all imaginable obſtraites; I ſay one poor unthought of accident, has on the ſuddain crack't and broke to ſhivers all this long elaborated project. That ſuddain and unexpected diſcovery of the long-elaborated Helliſh Gund-powder Plot in our Nation, is a pregnant inſtance of this; and many more might alſo be given.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The <hi>Miracles</hi> and extraordinary things that Sometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the World, contrary to the courſe of Nature, loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a <hi>Providence.</hi> 'Tis true, God does ſeldom alter the <hi>regular courſe</hi> he hath ſetled among his creatures. But ſometimes he <hi>does it,</hi> to acquaint the World with his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Prerogative,</hi> leſt otherwiſe the arrogance of men ſhould queſtion his Omnipotence, and be apt to ſuſpect he could not do it. Thus he made the <hi>Sun</hi> to ſtand ſtill at the prayer of <hi>Joſhua.</hi> Thus he commanded the <hi>fire</hi> not to burn the <hi>Three Worthies</hi> when thrown into the fiery Furnace.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66289:31"/> Thus he ſtopt the mouths of the <hi>Lyons,</hi> that they ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>Daniel.</hi> Who can bind the hands of the Almighty or hinder him from doing what he pleaſeth, both in Heaven above and in the Earth beneath.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The horrors of Conſcience that wicked men ſometimes feel upon their commiſſion of very ſecret ſins, is another argument of Providence. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.11. <hi>When thou with rebukes doſt correct man for iniquity, thou makeſt his beauty to conſume away like a Moth.</hi> God makes mens own Conſciences oftentimes chaſtiſe them for ſuch ſecret ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And thus much for proof both by <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> that there is a Providence; I come now to the Third thing I propounded to conſider, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>extent</hi> of this Divine Providence. Under this head I ſhall ſhew theſe two things.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That the Providence of God extends to <hi>all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. That in a more <hi>ſpecial</hi> and <hi>ſingular</hi> manner it manifeſts it ſelf for the good of his <hi>Church</hi> and People.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. The Providence of God reaches all his Creatures and all their actions. I ſhall labour to prove this by an <hi>induction</hi> of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It reaches things <hi>caſual,</hi> Prov. 16.33. <hi>The lot is caſt into the lap, but the whole diſpoſal thereof is from the Lord.</hi> God is ſaid to deliver <hi>him</hi> to a <hi>mans hand</hi> whom we ſuppoſe to be killed by chance; compare <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.13. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.4.5.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It reaches to things <hi>inanimate,</hi> viz. Natural Agents. The <hi>water</hi> riſes to that height that it drowns the <hi>Old World,</hi> when God commands it. The <hi>fire</hi> will not burn the Three Worthies, if God forbid it, <hi>Daniel</hi> 3.25.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It reaches to Creatures that have only the loweſt life, <hi>viz. Vegetables,</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> How wiſely hath God ordered thoſe things. Some <hi>Herbs</hi> he hath made good for <hi>food.</hi> Into <hi>others</hi> he hath put excellent <hi>Medicinal</hi> virtues, and hath made them good for <hi>Phyſick.</hi> Some <hi>Flowers</hi> have glorious out-ſides, <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory was not cloathed like one of them. Others
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66289:31"/> of them have <hi>rare qualities,</hi> and virtues beneficial to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It reaches to Creatures that have <hi>only ſenſe.</hi> Who can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently admire the wiſe <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> of <hi>Bees,</hi> and <hi>Ants,</hi> and <hi>Silk-worms? Flyes,</hi> and <hi>Lice</hi> and <hi>Frogs,</hi> the very corruption of the Earth, when they have received a commiſſion from God, are too ſtrong an Army for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> a mighty Prince. When all <hi>Egypt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides was peſtered with <hi>Flyes,</hi> the Land <hi>of Goſhen</hi> (a little ſpot in the midſt of it) was not moleſted with any; no not with <hi>Flyes,</hi> which cannot be kept out of any place. What <hi>Walls, Rivers,</hi> or <hi>Armies</hi> can hinder their motion, or prevent their entrance? And yet <hi>thoſe active</hi> ſprightly Creatures did not invade <hi>Goſhen,</hi> though they were round about it, when God forbade them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Providence of God reaches unto <hi>Angels. Good Angels</hi> he makes uſe of as his inſtruments in the government of the World, and ſends them abroad to <hi>ſerve</hi> and <hi>miniſter</hi> for the good of his People. As for <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>evil Angels,</hi> he hath them under <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,</hi> ſo that they can do no more then he permits them. And the <hi>curbing</hi> and <hi>reſtraining,</hi> ſuch malicious Spirits is a mighty ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Gods Providential care over us.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It reaches unto <hi>men.</hi> That will evidently appear if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt <hi>thing</hi> that ſpeaks Gods Providence and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over <hi>mankind</hi> is his giving them <hi>Laws.</hi>

                        <hi>he works in him both to will and to do that which is good,</hi> Phil. 2.13. 'Tis from God that men have any <hi>heart,</hi> or <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>power</hi> to do any thing pleaſing in his ſight. But Gods <hi>co-operating</hi> with, and aſſiſting man in the <hi>doing of good</hi> is not in any thing <hi>more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable</hi> then in the <hi>coverſion</hi> of a ſinner. He ſavingly <hi>inlightens</hi> the <hi>mind,</hi> he freely <hi>bowes</hi> and inclines the <hi>will,</hi> he <hi>circumciſes the heart</hi> as we find, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. he gives a <hi>new heart</hi> as 'tis, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.7. He takes away the <hi>heart of ſtone,</hi> and gives <hi>a heart of fleſh,</hi> he puts a new Spirit with them, as 'tis, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.29.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> God neither is, nor poſſibly can be the <hi>Author</hi> or <hi>Approver</hi> of it. Yet his Providence is exerciſed about it, as may appear by theſe particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He <hi>permits</hi> ſin. Without his permiſſion and ſufferance it could not be in the World. God is ſo <hi>good</hi> that he would never permit <hi>ſin,</hi> but that being <hi>Omnipotent</hi> he knows how to bring <hi>good</hi> out of it.</p>
                     <p>Now he may be ſaid to <hi>permit</hi> ſin in theſe reſpects, Firſt, By way of <hi>Negation,</hi> not giving grace to prevent it (which he is not bound to do being a Debtor to no man) or by not giving a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>ſoftning means,</hi> or by denying his bleſſing on the means, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.4. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays of the hardned <hi>Iſraelites. Yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to ſee, and ears to hear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day.</hi> God is ſaid to <hi>harden</hi> (ſays <hi>Auſtin</hi>) when he <hi>ſaftens not,</hi> and to <hi>blind</hi> when he <hi>enlightns not.</hi> He doth it not by imparting <hi>evil</hi> or <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> but by not <hi>imparting grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. By way of <hi>privation,</hi> by withdrawing (upon provocation) the <hi>reſtraining</hi> grace before given. Time was when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66289:32"/> reſtraint upon him; and while <hi>that</hi> laſted, there were no violent hands laid upon <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Aaron,</hi> by whoſe miniſtry all the Plagues were brought upon him. But <hi>this</hi> is no ſooner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from him, but his <hi>cruelty</hi> vents it ſelf and <hi>Moſes</hi> is threatned with death if he came again into his preſence.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By <hi>preſenting Objects</hi> which mans corruption makes a bad uſe of: Thus <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78 from 27, to 31. The <hi>Iſraelities</hi> abuſed their <hi>Quails,</hi> (which God ſo mercifully gave them) to the pampering of their luſts, and ſo brought his wrath upon them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. By <hi>delivering them up to Satan,</hi> to be by him <hi>blinded</hi> and <hi>miſled</hi> becauſe they refuſed to be guided by the <hi>good Spirit</hi> and <hi>word of God.</hi> Thus <hi>John</hi> 13.2. We read that the <hi>Devil</hi> put it into <hi>Judas</hi> his heart to betray his Lord and Maſter.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. By <hi>delivering them up to their own luſts,</hi> Pſal. 81.11.12. God ſayes, <hi>my People would not hearken to my voice, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of mee. So I gave them up unto their own hearts luſt, and they walked in their own counſels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. By way of <hi>puniſhment.</hi> One ſin is very often the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another. Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> when he ſaw that the <hi>Rain,</hi> and <hi>Hail</hi> and the <hi>Thunders</hi> were ceaſed, he <hi>ſinned</hi> yet more and <hi>hardned his heart, he</hi> and his <hi>Servants,</hi> Exod. 9.34. And <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks very pertinently to this purpoſe, <hi>Expedit ſuperbo, ut inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat in peccatum.</hi> God often ſuffers a <hi>proud</hi> man to fall into a <hi>ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſin,</hi> to puniſh his <hi>pride,</hi> and to bring him to a ſober ſence of himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God <hi>limits ſin</hi> and ſets bounds to it. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 76.10. <hi>Surely the wrath of men ſhall praiſe thee, the remainder of wrath thou wilt reſtrain.</hi> Thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.42. He with-held, <hi>Laban</hi> from his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed purpoſe of hurting <hi>Jacob.</hi> He that ſets <hi>bounds</hi> to the <hi>Sea:</hi> ſets bounds alſo to the <hi>ſins</hi> of men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He makes ſin it ſelf ſerve to his own glory, and ſo over-rules it, that he brings <hi>good</hi> out of it. Thus the <hi>unnatural</hi> uſage which <hi>Joſeph</hi> received from his Brethren; God ordered to his high ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and his Family's preſervation. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> malice in perſecuting the Diſciples, and ſending them out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (by Gods over-ruling) tended to the propagating, and diſperſing of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Having thus ſhewed the extent of the <hi>Divine Providence</hi> to the <hi>ſeveral Beings</hi> in the World, it remains now that I ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66289:33"/> of his <hi>ſpecial Providence</hi> which he exerciſes in a more <hi>ſingular way</hi> over his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> Which will plainly appear if we conſider theſe particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Sometimes he <hi>hinders and prevents evil</hi> intended againſt them. And this he does ſometimes by <hi>weak means,</hi> ſometimes by <hi>ſtrange means,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>without means.</hi> See a remarkable inſtance of this 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. from 9. to the 14. An Army of a <hi>Thouſand Thouſand</hi> Aethiopians came out againſt <hi>Aſa,</hi> and Verſe the 11th. he cried unto the Lord ſaying, <hi>Lord it is nothing with thee to help whether with many or with few: we have no power: help us O Lord our God, for we truſt in thee, and in thy name we go againſt this mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. O Lord thou art our God, let not man prevail againſt thee.</hi> So the Lord <hi>ſmote the</hi> Aethiopians <hi>before</hi> Aſa, <hi>and before</hi> Judah, <hi>and they were overthrown.</hi> Thus alſo 2 <hi>Chron,</hi> 20. When the Children of <hi>Moab, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Mount Seir,</hi> came againſt <hi>Jeh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſhaphat</hi> he proclaimed a <hi>Faſt</hi> and cried unto the Lord. Verſ. 12. <hi>O our God, we have no might againſt this great Company that cometh againſt us, neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi> Then upon <hi>Jahaziel</hi> came the <hi>Spirit of the Lord,</hi> and he ſaid unto the King and the People, <hi>Be not afraid by reaſon of this great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; for the Battle is not yours, but Gods. To morrow go down againſt them; you ſhall not need to fight in this Battle; ſet your ſelves, ſtand ye ſtill, and ſee the Salvation of the Lord. For the Lord will be with you.</hi> And <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> ſaid unto the People, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Lord, ſo ſhall ye be eſtabliſhed, believe his Prophets, ſo ſhall ye proſper.</hi> This done, the Lord immediately ſent a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>diviſion</hi> or <hi>ſtrife</hi> among their enemies, whereby thoſe Nations falling out among themſelves, deſtroyed one another, and <hi>ſheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Swords</hi> in one anothers bowels. See alſo to this purpoſe the whole 124 <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Sometimes he moderates and takes off the rage of Enemies, and makes them of <hi>Enemies</hi> to become <hi>Friends.</hi> Thus when <hi>Eſau</hi> had reſolv'd to ſlay his Brother <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 27.4. <hi>Jacob</hi> wraſtles that night with God in prayer. Chap. 32. Verſ. 11, 24, 26, 28. And Chap. 33. Verſ. 4. We find God had ſo changed the heart of <hi>Eſau,</hi> that inſtead of killing his Brother, he moſt lovingly embraces him, and fell upon his neck and kiſſed him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sometimes he ſnares the wicked in the work of their own hands when they have deſigned miſchief againſt his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:66289:33"/> Pſal. 9.16. <hi>The Lord is known by the Judgment he executeth: The wicked is ſnared in the work of his own hands.</hi> The whole Book of <hi>Heſter</hi> is a ſufficient proof of this. And we read <hi>Job</hi> 5.12. That <hi>he diſſappointeth the devices of the crafty, ſo that their hands cannot perform their enterprizes. Achitophel</hi> alſo is a remarkable inſtance of this, whoſe <hi>counſel</hi> againſt <hi>David</hi> God turned in <hi>fooliſhneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Sometimes he makes the wicked <hi>againſt their own will</hi> to fulfill <hi>his will.</hi> See what God ſays to the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> Iſai. 10.5, 6, 7. <hi>O</hi> Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, <hi>the Rod of mine anger, and the Staff in their hand is mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. I will ſend him againſt an Hypocritical Nation, and againſt the People of my wrath will I give him a charge; to take the Spoil and to take the Prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the Streets. Howbeit, he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo; but it is in his heart to deſtroy, and cut off Nations not a few. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> Brethren little thought when they ſo wretchedly ſold him, they had been advancing of him. But this is the <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> of Divine Providence to bring <hi>good</hi> out of <hi>evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. He uſually converts the <hi>outward evils</hi> that befall his People to their <hi>Spiritual good. Paul</hi> had a ſad Meſſenger of <hi>Satan</hi> ſent to buffet him, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.7. But this Meſſenger prov'd a means to prevent <hi>pride</hi> in him. Wicked men are God <hi>Scullions</hi> (as one calls them) and imployed by him to <hi>ſcour</hi> his Children, and to brighten their graces. <hi>Phyſick</hi> though it be not good to the <hi>Palat,</hi> yet it may be very good for the <hi>Patient. David</hi> found it ſo when he cried out, <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, before I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted I went aſtray, but now I have kept thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119.67, 68. And Iſai. 27.9. Sayes God, <hi>By this ſhall the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. And Laſtly, God very often <hi>qualifies</hi> the <hi>outward troubles</hi> of his People with <hi>inward comforts,</hi> and conſolations. Though the <hi>outward man</hi> ſmart, yet God can cauſe the <hi>Conſcience</hi> to ſmile. Though the outward eſtate be peeled, yet he can chear the heart. Thoſe <hi>Saints</hi> in the 11 of <hi>Heb.</hi> took joyfully the <hi>ſpoiling</hi> of their goods, <hi>remembring they had in Heaven a better and more induring ſubſtance.</hi> Hear what the bleſſed Apoſtle ſays, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Object.</hi> Another Objection againſt <hi>Providence</hi> is this, if the Providence of God governs the World, <hi>Cur malis bene, bonis male?</hi> Why fares it many times ſo <hi>well</hi> with the wicked? Why do they flouriſh like a green Bay-tree? While thoſe that are <hi>righteous,</hi> and good men meet with hard meaſure, and are miſerably haraſſed and afflicted. This matter we find debated by <hi>Job,</hi> in Chap. 21.7. And in Chap. 24.27. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> alſo inſiſts on it in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.73. And the Prophet <hi>Jerem.</hi> Chap. 12.1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That this oftentimes ſo happens, is plain and undeniable. And the <hi>Providence, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God in this diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is many times a myſtery and riddle to the Children of men. But the difficulty is ſoon diſſolved, if we will but attentively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things, which we ſpake ſomething to before, in anſwer to an Objection made againſt Gods <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. None are perfectly righteous here. Therefore even in the very beſt God may find ſomething for which juſtly to correct them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God may love his Children with a great love even then when he does ſorely afflict them.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="5">5. The <hi>outward calamities</hi> of the People of God, (through his ſanctifying of them) tend to the proſperity of their Souls, to the

                        </gap>r what <hi>improvement</hi> we ought to make of this Doctrine.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let us all own and acknowledge and take notice of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God actually working in the World. Let us not impute events, to <hi>chance,</hi> or <hi>fortune,</hi> or <hi>fate;</hi> but labour to ſee and take notice of an <hi>all-wiſe</hi> and <hi>Soveraign Providence,</hi> over-ruling, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and diſpoſing of all things here below. God is <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of the World, and <hi>does</hi> and <hi>will</hi> govern the Creatures he hath made.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let us earneſtly beg Gods <hi>Providential care</hi> over us, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly truſt our ſelves and our <hi>concernments</hi> to his diſpoſal. Let us ſtir up and excite our ſelves to depend on his <hi>Providence</hi> from ſuch conſiderations as theſe,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is no better way to obtain <hi>any good</hi> thing we deſire, than by an humble depending on God for it, and referring our ſelves to his holy will; no ſurer way to miſs any good thing we deſire, than to be <hi>peremptory,</hi> and <hi>inordinate</hi> in our deſire of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Why ſhould we not depend on God now, who took care of us in the Womb, and when we hung on our Mothers Breaſts, and hath all our life hitherto taken care of us?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. How eaſily can God help us, in our greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Why ſhould we not depend on God for <hi>acceſſaries</hi> on whom we muſt depend for the main?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It the Providence of God governs the World, let us not <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet</hi> our ſelves upon any of theſe accounts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe we are at preſent under many and various afflictions. <hi>For</hi> let us conſider, Firſt, all afflictions have their commiſſion from him, <hi>Job</hi> 5.6. <hi>Affliction comes not out of the duſt.</hi> 'Tis God that brings us and our afflictions together; Secondly, He ſuits and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions our afflictions.

                     <p n="2">2. Let us not diſquiet our ſelves in reference to our <hi>Poſterity.</hi> We are apt to be very <hi>thoughtfull,</hi> what will become of our Children which we ſhall leave behind us. But let us conſider though <hi>we muſt go hence,</hi> yet the <hi>Providence</hi> of God never <hi>dyes.</hi> Gen. 48.21. <hi>Behold I die</hi> (ſays <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Joſeph) but God ſhall be with you, and bring you again to the Land of your Fathers.</hi> Let us commit our Children to the care of that gracious Providence, which hath watched over us, for our good all our days.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let us not diſquiet our ſelves in reference to the <hi>Church</hi> of God. Let us remember what our Saviour hath promiſed, <hi>viz. That the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt his Church,</hi> Matth. 16.18.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Let us labour to get an intereſt in the <hi>Eſſential love</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> of this God who governs the World by his Providence, if he be <hi>our reconciled Father</hi> in Chriſt, we need not fear what Men or Devils can do unto us.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Let us ſtudy the <hi>promiſes,</hi> eſpecially thoſe that are made to aſſure us of Gods <hi>caring</hi> for us: Such as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>We know that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpoſe.</hi> See alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Naturall,</hi> which was written or imprinted upon his Soul in his firſt Creation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Poſitive,</hi> given (as is probable) by ſome external diſcovery or revelation, and impoſed on man to try whether he would be obedient to his Creator, or no.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Law of Nature</hi> as ſubjected in mans mind, conſiſts in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>practical Notions,</hi> or <hi>Rules</hi> about <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil, right</hi> and <hi>wrong, true</hi> and <hi>falſe, juſt</hi> and <hi>unjuſt, honeſt</hi> and <hi>diſhoneſt.</hi> And mans <hi>will</hi> was diſpos'd and inclin'd to conform to the Dictates of this <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that theſe <hi>Natural Laws</hi> (by which <hi>Man</hi> was to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which were at firſt ſtamped on his Soul,) were ſuch as were exceeding agreeable to his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and ſutable to the inclinations of his <hi>will,</hi> and not at all contradicted or oppoſed by <hi>any principle</hi> within him, which might make him doubtful about his duty, or <hi>diſincline</hi> him to the performance of it. So that <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>innocency</hi> was indued with ſufficient ability to conform to the whole <hi>Law</hi> of God, both <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Poſitive.</hi> He was furniſhed with <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Principles</hi> inclining him to comply with whatſoever the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> preſcribed, and with a <hi>general Principle</hi> diſpoſing him to yield obedience to whatſoever any <hi>poſitive Law,</hi> as the <hi>declared will</hi> of God, ſhould injoin,</p>

                  <p>Thus much of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> I come now to ſhew what <hi>poſitive Law</hi> God gave <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works.</note>God having placed our <hi>firſt Parents</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> beſides the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> which he wrote on their hearts, he gave them alſo a <hi>poſitive command</hi> to aſſert his <hi>right</hi> and <hi>dominion</hi> over them as their <hi>Creator,</hi> that they might be obliged to do <hi>ſomething</hi> becauſe it was their <hi>Creators will,</hi> as well as <hi>other things,</hi> becauſe they appeared in their own Nature <hi>reaſonable</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> to be done.

God therefore gave <hi>Adam</hi> a <hi>poſitive Law</hi> as a <hi>teſt</hi> or <hi>proof</hi> of his obedience, and to try him how he would behave himſelf towards his <hi>Maker,</hi> Gen. 2.16, 17. <hi>And the Lord God commanded the man, ſaying, of every Tree of the Garden thou mayeſt freely eat: but of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, thou ſhalt not eat of it, for in the day that thou eateſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of of thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe words is contained <hi>the Covenant</hi> that God made with <hi>man</hi> at firſt and which is commonly called the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> or <hi>Covenant of Nature,</hi> being made with man in the time of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Nature.

                  <p>Now a <hi>Covenant</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi> is not to be conſidered as between <hi>man</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> where <hi>conſent</hi> is mutually requiſite. For <hi>man</hi> was bound to accept the <hi>terms</hi> God offered him, being in themſelves exceeding reaſonable. God is an <hi>abſolute Lord,</hi> and hath full power in his hands to give and impoſe what <hi>Laws</hi> he pleaſes on his Creatures, and to require what <hi>duties,</hi> and impoſe what <hi>conditions</hi> he ſees good, and man is bound to accept, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> ſo propounded, and impoſed. And in a <hi>dutiful performance</hi> of the <hi>conditions</hi> on his part required, he may expect the benefits promiſed.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore it will be requiſite,</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe God promiſes <hi>Adam life</hi> if he obey. As if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Till the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely live.</hi> So much muſt needs be included.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. If our firſt Parents fell from God by diſobedience in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> how ſhould we tremble that walk in a corrupt World, and carry corrupt hearts about us? How ought we to ceaſe from truſting in our ſelves, and to put all our truſt and confidence in God. If the Devil prevailed over <hi>Adam,</hi> how much more eaſily may he prevail over us? If he could deceive by a <hi>Serpent,</hi> how much more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may he deceive, when he uſes <hi>men</hi> for his inſtruments that are like our ſelves. And this is further to be obſerv'd, that the more <hi>godly</hi> any are, the more will the Devil labour to foil them. For if he can foil <hi>one</hi> of them, he blurs their profeſſion, and by ſuch a ſcandal makes others ſhy of it. Oh do you not ſee (will the World then ſay) what kind of <hi>Saints</hi> theſe are? They are all ſuch. Saints in <hi>profeſſion,</hi> but Hypocrites at the heart. And thus by the falls of Profeſſors the Devil mightily advances his own Kingdom.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Seeing we were all involved in the <hi>guilt</hi> of our firſt Parents diſobedience and ſeeing we have received from them by our imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Parents a <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>depraved Nature;</hi> let us conſider that this is no eſtate to be reſted in.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The way and means of his recovery by Chriſt, Man</hi> by his <hi>fall</hi> having made himſelf uncapable of life by <hi>this firſt Covenant,</hi> viz. <hi>The Covenant of Works,</hi> it pleaſed the Lord to make a <hi>Second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> with him, namely the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace.</note> wherein he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offers unto ſinners <hi>life</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> requiring they ſhould <hi>repent</hi> of their ſins and <hi>believe</hi> in him that they may be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>In treating of <hi>this Covenant</hi> that I may proceed more <hi>methodical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> I ſhall</p>

                  <p n="1">1. They agree in the <hi>Author.</hi> God is the Author of them both.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They agree in the <hi>parties concerned. God</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> are the Parties concerned in both Covenants.</p>

                  <p>In the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> there was indeed an <hi>act of Faith</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>viz.</hi> that God would give the <hi>bleſſed life</hi> promiſed upon mans performance of his duty and obedience, but it was not ſuch a <hi>Faith</hi> as is required in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> which is the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> and <hi>apprehending</hi> and truſting our Souls on the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is wrought for us by the <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience of Chriſt.

                     </gap>. 4.13. <hi>I can do all things</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me.</hi> Therefore the obedience of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66289:42"/> Goſpel is called the <hi>obedience of Faith.</hi> Rom. 16.26. as following <hi>Faith</hi> and ſpringing from it. <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> are not ſo in mans power now as <hi>Obedience</hi> was under the <hi>Covenant of Works.</hi> And ſecondly, it doth not require <hi>works</hi> for the <hi>ſame end.</hi> For the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> requires <hi>works</hi> as the way and means of our ſtanding right before God. But the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> doth not require <hi>works</hi> as the matter of our Righteouſneſs and Juſtification before God, but that thereby we ſhould glorify God in this World, be fitted for Heaven, and ſhould evidence and teſtifie our renewed nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> there was no <hi>Mediator.</hi> But in the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> there is. Therefore the one is called <hi>Foedus amicitiae,</hi> the other <hi>Foedus miſericordiae.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3.

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> gave unto man ſome occaſion as it were to glory, if he had ſtood. But the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> cuts off from Man all pretence to glory in himſelf, and engages him to give all the glory intirely unto God. So ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Where is boaſting then? It is excluded. By what Law? of Works. Nay: But by the Law of Faith.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.31. The Apoſtle tells us <hi>Chriſt is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> and <hi>Redemption. He that glorieth let him glory in the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.9. By <hi>grace are ye ſaved, through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God: not of Works leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> Having thus ſhewed the <hi>agreement</hi> and <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> between theſe two Covenants.</p>
                  <p>I come now to ſpeak more <hi>particularly</hi> of the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> Concerning which let us obſerve theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> was for ſubſtance <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> in all ages of the Church, though diverſly adminiſtred <hi>before,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> the coming of Chriſt. From <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> and ſo on from <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the end of the World, the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> hath been <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame,</hi> without change
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66289:43"/> or alteration. Yet it was adminiſtred in a <hi>different manner</hi> under the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> and thence it had the denomination of <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Covenant. Yet both did <hi>agree</hi> in many things, As</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Of the</hi> old adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of Grace &amp; of the new.</note>1. They both lead to <hi>one and the ſame Mediator, by</hi> and <hi>through</hi> whom the bleſſings promiſed are to be expected; Chriſt at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection raiſed up (together with himſelf) many of the Saints who died under the <hi>former Covenant</hi> as we read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.52. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhewed that the benefit of his <hi>Mediation, Death</hi> and <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> did belong to them under the <hi>old</hi> Covenant as well as to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>new.</hi> But ſome will perhaps ſay that Chriſt is called the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the New Teſtament. Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is ſo in reſpect of <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>perſonal</hi> confirmation of it by <hi>his own blood,</hi> which was not done in the old Covenant. But he was <hi>Mediator of the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> as may appear by the <hi>types</hi> that did prefigure him, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of his blood which was to be ſhed, which did take away the ſins committed under the old Covenant as to them that truly believed in him. Hereunto agrees <hi>that</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever,</hi> that is, as to the vertue of his death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſame condition is required under both adminiſtrations, namely <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in the Meſſiah. 'Tis true, many of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the <hi>old Covenant</hi> ſought Righteouſneſs <hi>by the works of the Law,</hi> and not by Faith in the Meſſiah, but this was their <hi>error</hi> and <hi>ſin.</hi> It was not the true Doctrine of that Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Under both there was the <hi>ſame Law</hi> and <hi>Rule of Life</hi> to walk by, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Moral Law. Jam.</hi> 28. This Law is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     </gap>, a <hi>Royal</hi> or a <hi>Kingly Law,</hi> becauſe it hath a <hi>Kingly</hi> and authoritative power over all Mankind.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They both propound the <hi>ſame Salvation.</hi> God would not have called himſelf the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> if <hi>they</hi> had not been ſaved. Neither would the <hi>place of Reſt</hi> ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e been called <hi>Abrahams boſome,</hi> if <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf had not had part in that place of Reſt. But ſome will object, Heb. 8.8 9. Where 'tis ſaid, <hi>the New Covenant is not as the Old.</hi> I anſwer, We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and the <hi>manner</hi> of its diſpenſation. In reſpect of the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,</hi> the <hi>new</hi> is not as the <hi>old</hi> though it be as to ſubſtance. As <hi>Rebecca</hi> vailed, and unvailed was the ſame woman, and yet not the ſame. The ſame in <hi>perſon,</hi> not the ſame in <hi>habit</hi> and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66289:43"/> 
                     <hi>attire.</hi> That which brought the <hi>bleſſing</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> was this, that he believed on <hi>that ſeed,</hi> which was to ſpring from him, looking for Righteouſneſs and Life by him. So then the <hi>old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> ſpoken of in the <hi>old teſtament</hi> and <hi>the new,</hi> which is now publiſhed in the Goſpel, are for ſubſtance <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any eſſential difference between them. But though they thus <hi>agreed,</hi> yet in many things they differed. As particularly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>old adminiſtration of the Covenant of Grace</hi> was more burthenſome, the new is more eaſie, this the Apoſtle plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. <hi>Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the Diſciples, which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear.</hi> And Gal. 4.3. <hi>Even ſo we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the World.</hi> There were required under the <hi>old Covenant, Circumciſion, coſtly Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Oblations, tedious journeys to Jeruſalem, at the three ſolemn feaſts, reſtraint from many liberties</hi> which we enjoy under the <hi>new.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>one</hi> was more dark, the <hi>other</hi> is more clear. Eternal life was not ſo clearly diſcovered in the old Teſtament as it is in the new, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. Yea Chriſt himſelf and his offices, and benefits were then but darkly revealed. Hence the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is called <hi>the revelation of the myſtery kept ſecret ſince the World began,</hi> Rom. 16.25. not that it was <hi>abſolutely</hi> hid or kept ſecret, but <hi>comparatively</hi> in reſpect of the more clear and plain diſcovery of it afforded to us in theſe dayes. Hence <hi>that</hi> of our Saviour to his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.16, 17. <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes for they ſee; and your ears, for they hear, for verily I ſay unto you that many Prophets and Righteous men have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them: and to hear thoſe things which ye hear and have not heard them.</hi> It was meet that the glory of a clearer diſcovery of eternal life ſhould be reſerved to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Now the veil is done away.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A leſs forcible influence and efficacy accompanied the <hi>old</hi> adminiſtration than doth the <hi>new.</hi> The ſpirit of Chriſt is now poured forth more abundantly ſince his Aſcenſion, and a more mighty operation of the Spirit accompanies the miniſtry of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A more <hi>ſervile ſpirit</hi> acted in thoſe who were under the <hi>old Adminiſtration</hi> they being drawn generally more by
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66289:44"/> the terrors of the Law, than by the promiſes of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In reſpect of extent, they much differ. For the <hi>old</hi> was revealed but to few in compariſon, <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi> and their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes,</hi> whereas the grace of the Goſpel is held forth to all Nations.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>old Covenant</hi> was to laſt but for a time, <hi>viz. till the time of reformation. Heb.</hi> 9.10. but the <hi>new</hi> is to laſt unto the end of the world, and ſhall never wax <hi>old</hi> or wear away.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They differ in reſpect of their Sacraments. <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> which were the chief Sacraments under the old Adminiſtration were bloody Sacraments, for Chriſts blood was then <hi>to be ſhed.</hi> But under the <hi>new,</hi> our <hi>Sacraments</hi> are <hi>unbloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> for Chriſts blood <hi>is ſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. They differ as to the manner of their ratification. The old was ratified by the blood of the <hi>Levitical Sacrifices,</hi> the new by the blood of the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>Having thus ſpoken of the Covenant of Grace <hi>in the general,</hi> and of the <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new</hi> diſpenſation thereof in <hi>particular,</hi> let us now conſider what uſe we are to make of this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us bleſs God for making <hi>this Covenant</hi> with faln Man. Let us conſider the <hi>freeneſs</hi> of it. There was nothing in us but our <hi>miſery</hi> to move him to it. And he made <hi>no ſuch Covenant</hi> with the <hi>Angels</hi> that fell. 2. Let us conſider the <hi>ſureneſs</hi> of it; God hath confirmed it. 1. by his <hi>word</hi> and <hi>promiſe,</hi> 2. by his <hi>oath.</hi> 3. by his <hi>ſea.</hi> 'Tis indeed called ſometimes a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and ſometimes a <hi>Teſtament.</hi> A <hi>Covenant</hi> with reference to <hi>God the Father</hi> who hath made this gracious Covenant with the children of men, and in it hath promiſed many great <hi>priviledges</hi> and <hi>bleſſings</hi> unto them that perform the conditions therein required.

                     <note place="margin">Jeſus.</note> which ſignifies a <hi>Saviour.</hi> God by an <hi>Angel</hi> gave him that name, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. He was deſigned by God the Father to perform for the Children of Men whatſoever is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in his <hi>name. Jeſus</hi> denotes the work and buſineſs for which he came into the World. The Angel told the Shepherds, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.11. <hi>unto you is born this day in the City of David</hi> a Saviour, <hi>who is Chriſt the Lord,</hi> ſo 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners,</hi> and here let us conſider how <hi>Jeſus</hi> is a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and why truly and properly ſo called. This will more particularly appear, if we conſider the <hi>great evils</hi> he ſaves us from, and the <hi>great benefits</hi> he hath purchaſed for us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſaves us from the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin.

                  <p n="2">2. From the <hi>dominion</hi> of ſin, we have a promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. that <hi>ſin ſhall not have dominion over us,</hi> becauſe we are not under the Law as <hi>a Covenant of Works</hi> exacting perfect obedience, and miniſtring no ſtrength to perform it; but under a <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> in Chriſt which miniſters ſtrength to reſiſt ſin and overcome it. So <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that Chriſt gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. From the <hi>curſe of the Law.</hi> He came not to take away the <hi>Law</hi> as a <hi>rule of life,</hi> but to free us from the curſe of it. <hi>He hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, by being made a curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13.</p>

                  <p>In the old Teſtament <hi>three ſorts</hi> of perſons were anointed, <hi>Kings, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi> To theſe <hi>three Offices</hi> was <hi>Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,</hi> and took them all on him for our benefit.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt was a <hi>Prieſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chriſt was</hi> a Prieſt.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are Two parts of his <hi>Prieſt-hood</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Oblation.</hi>

                        <item>

                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Oblation.</hi> We were all liable by reaſon of our ſins, to <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal puniſhment,</hi> from which we could not be freed except our ſins were remitted. Now <hi>without ſhedding of blood there was no remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Heb.</hi> 9.22. It was therefore neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to put away ſin, by the Sacrifice of himſelf,</hi> Heb. 9.26.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When Jeſus had offered up himſelf a <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifice</hi> for our ſins. He <hi>aſcended up on high,</hi> and entred into the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> to make <hi>interceſſion</hi> for us, Rom. 8.34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> Heb. 7.25. <hi>He ever liveth to make interceſſion for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the time of the <hi>Old Levitical Prieſt-hood</hi> the <hi>High-Prieſts</hi> Office had two Parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Oblation</hi> to offer up Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Preſentation</hi> of it in the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> with prayer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion unto God to accept it for the ſins of the People. See <hi>Levit.</hi> 16 from 11, to 17.</p>
                  <p>Now in anſwer to <hi>this Type</hi> there are two diſtinct parts of Chriſts <hi>Prieſt-hood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The offering up himſelf a Sacrifice on the Croſs for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. which anſwers to the killing of the Sacrifice without the Holy of Holies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He carried <hi>this his Blood</hi> virtually <hi>into the Holy of Holies,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into <hi>Heaven,</hi> Heb. 9.12. where he appears and there alſo prays and intercedes for us in the virtue and merit of <hi>that Blood.</hi> And the Type of thoſe prayers was the <hi>Cloud of Incenſe</hi> made by the High Prieſt. Both theſe parts of his Prieſthood the Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. Where he calls Chriſt a <hi>Propitiation</hi> or <hi>a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Sacrifice</hi> for our ſins, and an <hi>Advocate</hi> to the Father for us. Chriſt therefore offered a <hi>Satisfactory Sacrifice</hi> to God for us on the Croſs, and now <hi>intercedes</hi> for us in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The virtue of Chriſts Prieſt-hood began with the <hi>firſt ſinner</hi> that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66289:48"/> was pardoned. By <hi>him alone</hi> all that are pardoned are accepted, and <hi>without him</hi> none ever <hi>were,</hi> or <hi>will be</hi> accepted. His blood was reputed by God <hi>as ſhed</hi> from the time that the <hi>firſt Promiſe</hi> of the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> was made; namely, that <hi>the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpents Head,</hi> Gen. 3.15. And therefore Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. to be <hi>a Lamb ſlain from the beginning,</hi> that is, in <hi>Gods Decree;</hi> So that <hi>the Fathers</hi> that lived before he was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, injoyed the benefit of his Death and Sufferings. <hi>They</hi> were ſaved <hi>merito pretii praeſtandi,</hi> as we are ſaved <hi>merito pretii praeſtiti.</hi> And of this Prieſthood of our Saviour there is <hi>no end</hi> in regard of the <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of it. And thus we ſee how Chriſt was our Prieſt and how he made atonement for our ſins by his perfect obedience and ſufferings. His Perſon <hi>God-man</hi> was the <hi>Prieſt.</hi> The <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was <hi>his humanity,</hi> the <hi>Lamb of God</hi> without blemiſh. The <hi>Altar</hi> which conſecrated <hi>this Sacrifice</hi> and added <hi>merit</hi> to the ſufferings of his humanity was his <hi>God-head.</hi> And thus he made himſelf a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for our ſins. Three things Chriſt hath done for us as our <hi>Prieſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. He hath obeyed the Law perfectly.</item>
                     <item>2. He hath offered up himſelf a Sacrifice for our ſins.</item>
                     <item>3. He now lives to make interceſſion for us.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>From all that hath been ſaid we ſhould learn theſe leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſts <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience is of ſufficient <hi>value, worth</hi> and <hi>merit,</hi> to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice for all our ſins. For in that he <hi>voluntarily</hi> took on him our humane nature, and ſo <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily</hi> put himſelf under the obligation of the Law, his very <hi>active obedience</hi> becomes meritorious.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Chriſt did intend his obedience and ſufferings for this end and purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That God has accepted of what Chriſt has done and ſuffered as a <hi>ſufficient price</hi> for our Redemption.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſhould learn from hence highly to prize Chriſts <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>great relief</hi> we have againſt ſin. He has made <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to Divine Juſtice, ſo that God is now reconcilable to fallen Man <hi>in</hi> and <hi>through him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. This ſhould teach us to have a great care of our <hi>precious ſouls.</hi> The <hi>great price</hi> paid to ranſom them ſhould teach us their worth. We are wont to be exceeding careful to keep things
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66289:49"/> that coſt <hi>dear.</hi> Never any thing coſt more than the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Seeing Chriſt was <hi>Crucified</hi> for our ſins, we ſhould learn from him <hi>to crucifie ſin</hi> in our ſelves, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>They that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with its affections and luſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Seeing Chriſt ſuffered ſo much for us, we ſhould be content, yea ready to ſuffer for him when ever he calls us to it.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. From the conſideration of Chriſts <hi>interceſſion</hi> and the <hi>conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>prevalency</hi> of it, we ſhould encourage our ſelves to go to God <hi>in</hi> and <hi>through</hi> him for help in all our needs. He is a powerful <hi>advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Conſideration of Chriſts <hi>oblation</hi> of himſelf once for us, and his continual interceſſion ſtill performed in heaven for us, ſhould inflame our hearts with intire love to him. He deſerves our beſt, our moſt inlarged affections. We can never love him enough. I come now to Chriſts third Office.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt was a <hi>King.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt was a King.</note> God ſpeaking of his <hi>Son, Pſal.</hi> 2.6. ſays, <hi>I have ſet my King upon my holy hill of Zion.</hi> Zech. 9.9. <hi>Rejoyce greatly, O daughter of Zion; ſhout O daughter of Jeruſalem: Behold, thy King cometh unto thee: He is juſt, and having Salvation, lowly, and riding upon an Aſſe, and upon a colt, the fole of an Aſſe.</hi> This is applied to our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.5. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> fully atteſts this. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7. <hi>For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the Government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder: and his name ſhall be called, Wonderful, Counſeller, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increaſe of his Government and Peace there ſhall be no end; upon the Throne of David, and of his Kingdome ſhall he ſit, to order it, and to eſtabliſh it with Judgment and with Juſtice, from henceforth even for ever: the zeal of the Lord of Hoſts will perform this.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 1.33. 'Tis ſaid of Him, <hi>He ſhall reign over the houſe of Jacob for ever, and of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end.</hi> To which we may add <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14. <hi>Theſe ſhall make War with the Lamb, and the Lamb ſhall overcome them: for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</hi> Now there is a <hi>twofold Kingdom</hi> belonging to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Regnum Eſſentiale,</hi> an <hi>eſſential Kingdom</hi> which belongs to him as <hi>God.</hi>

Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By reſtraining, and curbing, and ſubduing <hi>His</hi> and <hi>His Churches</hi> enemies. Particularly,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Sin,</hi> that it ſhall not have dominion over thoſe that are His.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſhould all examine our ſelves whether <hi>his Kingdom</hi> beſet up in <hi>us</hi> or no. Chriſt is ſometimes called <hi>the Head of the Church,</hi> Eph. 1.22, 23. Let us ſeriouſly conſider whether we are guided and governed by him as the members of the body are by the Head? and whether we do receive <hi>life</hi> and <hi>influence</hi> from him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If Chriſt be a King, then we may aſſure our ſelves that he is able to defend his Church, and ſubdue the enemies of it, though they be never ſo ſtrong or ſubtil.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If Chriſt be a King, then we ſhould acknowledge his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10 11. <hi>That at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, and things under the Earth: And that every tongue ſhould confeſs, that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66289:50"/> To bow at the name of Jeſus is to confeſs his Soveraignty,</hi> to <hi>ſubmit to his power,</hi> and to <hi>humble our ſelves before him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. If Chriſt be a King? We ſhould pray that the Kingdoms contrary to his Kingdom, may be ſubverted, <hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Sin, Satan,</hi> and <hi>Anti-Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus much of Chriſts <hi>three-fold Office.</hi> We come now to ſpeak of the <hi>third Title</hi> given him in the antient Creed which is, <hi>His only Son,</hi> Chriſt is the only Son of God. Thus <hi>Nathanael</hi> the true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> makes his confeſſion of him, <hi>John</hi> 1.49. <hi>Rabbi thou art the Son of God, thou art King of</hi> Iſrael. Thus <hi>Martha</hi> expreſſes her Faith concerning him, <hi>John</hi> 11.27. <hi>I believe that thou art the Chriſt, the Son of God, which ſhould come into the World.</hi> This was the famous confeſſion of <hi>Peter, John.</hi> 6.69.<note place="margin">His only Son.</note> 
                     <hi>We believe and are ſure that thou art that Chriſt, the Son of the living God,</hi> Mat. 16.16. <hi>And Simon Peter anſwered and ſaid, Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God.</hi> And the Goſpel of <hi>John</hi> was written that <hi>we might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God,</hi> John 20.31. Now Chriſt is <hi>ſo</hi> the <hi>Son of God</hi> as no other <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>was,</hi> or ever <hi>can be.</hi> He is <hi>his only Son,</hi> his <hi>only begotten Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I ſhall further explain by theſe particulars following.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Our Saviour had a <hi>real being</hi> and <hi>exiſtence</hi> before his concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here on Earth, and <hi>diſtinct from that being</hi> which he aſſumed here, <hi>John</hi> 8.58. <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am.</hi> Yea he had a <hi>Being</hi> before the <hi>Flood,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſins, the Juſt for the unjuſt, (that he might bring us to God) being put to death in the fleſh, but quickned in the Spirit: By which alſo he went and preached to the Spirits</hi> (now) in <hi>priſon who were diſobedient in the days of</hi> Noah. Yea he had a being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World began: for <hi>the World was made by him,</hi> ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>God hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the Worlds:</hi> Col. 1.17. <hi>He is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>being</hi> which he had before his conception was not a <hi>created being,</hi> but <hi>the Divine Eſſence,</hi> he was <hi>truly God,</hi> John 17.5. <hi>And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the World was.</hi> See more in the third Section of the firſt Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Divine Eſſence</hi> which he hath, was eternally commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66289:51"/> to him from the Father (who was always Father as well as always God;) And this is called <hi>his Eternal Generation.</hi> And therefore he is called <hi>the only begotten Son of God,</hi> John 3.16. <hi>For God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son: That whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> And thus he is diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi>) and from the <hi>Adopted Sons of God,</hi> being his <hi>Eternal</hi> Son by eternal and ineffable Emanation. Joh. 7.29. <hi>I know him that ſent me</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>for I am from him,</hi> Joh. 1.18 <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time; the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi> B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t ſome will (poſſibly) here object, God the Father ſays of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.30, 33. <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> To which we anſwer, God ſpeaks not there of Chriſts <hi>Generation,</hi> but of the <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of it, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed at the time of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> by which <hi>he was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily declared to be the Son of God,</hi> Rom. 1.4. And though he was then <hi>declar'd</hi> to <hi>be ſo,</hi> yet his <hi>Generation</hi> was <hi>Eternal.</hi> The <hi>Grave</hi> is as the Womb of the Earth. Chriſt, when he was raiſed from the dead was (as it were) begotten to a new life, and on this account God who now raiſed him is ſtiled his Father. But ſome will further Object. Chriſt is called <hi>The firſt Born of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> Col. 1.15. How can he then be the Eternal Son of God? I anſwer, he is call'd <hi>The firſt born of every Creature,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>begotten of God</hi> as the Son of his love, <hi>antecedently</hi> to all other Emanations from him, and before any thing was framed or created by him.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the Explication of this <hi>Article.</hi> Let us now conſider what improvement we ſhould make of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This ſhould ſhew us the <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> of the Perſon of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and ſhould aſſure us of the infinite <hi>value</hi> of his <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As our offences are <hi>aggravated</hi> by the conſideration of the <hi>high dignity of the Perſon</hi> whom we have offended, ſo the <hi>value of Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> ariſeth from the <hi>dignity of the Perſon</hi> ſatisfying. And <hi>this ſatisfaction</hi> conſiſteth in the reparation of <hi>the honour</hi> which by our ſin was cclipſed. And all <hi>honour</hi> doth increaſe <hi>proportionably</hi> as the perſon yielding it is more honourable or worthy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This may ſhew us that the more worthy the Perſon of Chriſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66289:51"/> was before he ſuffered, the greater was his <hi>condeſcention in</hi> ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch great and unworthy ſufferings for our ſakes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This greatly magnifies the love of God in ſending <hi>his only begotten Son</hi> into the world to die for Sinners. This love of God is frequently extolled and admired by the Apoſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our Sins.</hi> What an amazing thing is this love of the Father in ſending <hi>his only begotten Son</hi> to be our Redeemer, and what an amazing thing is this <hi>condeſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>only Son</hi> of God to dy for ſuch worms as we are.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Lord</hi> ſignifies properly <hi>Dominion,</hi> and implies a <hi>right</hi> of <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> and power of <hi>diſpoſing.</hi> This premiſed, let us conſider <hi>how</hi> and in <hi>what reſpects</hi> Chriſt is Lord?</p>
                  <p>As there are <hi>two natures</hi> united in the perſon of Chriſt, ſo there are <hi>two kinds of dominion</hi> belonging reſpectively to thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>One</hi> inherent in his <hi>Divinity;</hi> the <hi>other</hi> beſtowed on his <hi>humanity. One</hi> by which he is <hi>Lord,</hi> maker of all things. The <hi>other</hi> by which he is made Lord of all things.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt <hi>as God</hi> hath a ſupreme univerſal dominion over the Worlp. So <hi>Thomas</hi> acknowledges in thoſe words, <hi>John</hi> 20.28. <hi>My Lord and my God.</hi> But Chriſt as <hi>Mediator</hi> has ſome kind of <hi>dominion</hi> or <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> beſtowed on him, and given unto him. And in this ſenſe the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66289:52"/> Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. <hi>He was made both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> And one branch of this his dominion, was <hi>his power on earth to forgive ſins,</hi> Mat. 9.2, 6. <hi>He ſaid therefore to the ſick of the Palſie thy ſins are forgiven thee, that they might know that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But let us further conſider by what <hi>right</hi> Chriſt is Lord.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By right of <hi>Creation, Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By right of <hi>ſuſtentation,</hi> and <hi>preſervation</hi> of the Creatures he hath made, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17. <hi>And he is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt,</hi> Heb. 1.3. <hi>He upholdeth all things by the word of his power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. By right of <hi>donation, ordination,</hi> and the <hi>appointment</hi> of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. <hi>To him all power is given both in Heaven and Earth.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4.

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Of the Perſon of Chriſt.</head>
                  <p>WE come now to conſider what manner of perſon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was. He was <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> in the ſame Perſon: The <hi>Eternal Son of God,</hi> the <hi>ſecond perſon</hi> in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> took to himſelf our <hi>humane nature</hi> (a humane Soul and Body) and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it after a wonderful manner, to his God-head, and ſo God and Man became one perſon. This I ſhall labour to make out by theſe ſeven following particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Jeſus Chriſt who was God before by the <hi>Divine nature</hi> which he had from Eternity, was in the fulneſs of time made Man, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He was made <hi>Man</hi> by aſſuming our humane nature unto himſelf, and joyning it to his Divine nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Although our <hi>humane</hi> nature was joyned with his <hi>Divine</hi> nature, (that is, with the nature common to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt) yet was that Union made only in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Son.</hi> Not the <hi>Father</hi> nor the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but it was the <hi>Son,</hi> that was incarnate.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Divine nature</hi> did not aſſume an <hi>humane</hi> perſon; but the <hi>Divine Perſon</hi> of the Son did aſſume our <hi>humane nature.</hi> If Chriſt had only taken the <hi>Perſon</hi> of a man, then there muſt have been <hi>two Perſons</hi> in Chriſt, (a Perſon <hi>aſſuming</hi> and a Perſon <hi>aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;</hi>) Yea, then <hi>that only Perſon</hi> which Chriſt had aſſumed ſhould have been advanced, and ſaved by him. He therefore aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed not an <hi>humane Perſon,</hi> but he aſſumed the <hi>humane nature</hi> common to all the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. He took an <hi>humane Soul</hi> as well as an <hi>humane Body.</hi> For he <hi>increaſed in wiſdom and ſtature,</hi> Luke 2.52. In the <hi>one,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66289:53"/> of his <hi>body,</hi> in the <hi>other,</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>Soul.</hi> He, whoſe <hi>knowledge</hi> did increaſe with his years, muſt have a <hi>Subject</hi> proper for it, which is no other than an <hi>humane Soul.</hi> This was the <hi>Seat</hi> of his <hi>finite underſtanding,</hi> and <hi>directed will,</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>will of his Father,</hi> and conſequently of his <hi>Divine nature</hi> as may appear by that, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.42. <hi>Not my Will, but thine be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. In this union the <hi>two natures</hi> remain really <hi>diſtinct</hi> in Chriſt, without either converſion or tranſubſtantiation of the one into the other; and without commixtion or confuſion of <hi>both</hi> into <hi>one.</hi> There was no converſion of the <hi>humane</hi> nature into the <hi>Divine,</hi> or of the <hi>Divine</hi> into the <hi>humane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Though with us the Soul and Body being united make a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet in Chriſt the Soul and Body were ſo united, as to have their ſubſiſtence not <hi>of themſelves</hi> (as <hi>in us</hi>) but in the <hi>God-head.</hi> No ſooner was the Soul united to the Body, but both Soul and Body had their ſubſiſtence in the <hi>Second Perſon in</hi> the <hi>Trinity.</hi>

The humane nature of Chriſt was totally ſanctified, and ſo fitted for a perſonal union with the <hi>Word,</hi> John 17.19. <hi>For their ſakes I ſanctified my ſelf.</hi> Chriſt out of his infinite love humbled himſelf and became <hi>Man:</hi> Yet at the ſame time, out of his infinite purity, he would not defile himſelf by becoming ſinful man. The <hi>humane nature</hi> in its firſt original was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and in its formation <hi>ſanctified</hi> and ſo united to the <hi>Word;</hi> that as the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> was the fountain of our <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> ſo the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> might be the fountain of our <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt took our nature cloathed with <hi>ſinleſs infirmities:</hi> Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and <hi>ſinful</hi> infirmities he did not take on him. Indeed poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal infirmities ſuch as are <hi>common to all the Sons and Daughters of</hi> Adam (as to be ſubject to pain, grief, and ſorrow, hunger, thirſt, cold, &amp;c.) ſuch he took on him, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. v. 4. <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs and carried our ſorrows:</hi>) But he took not on him poenal infirmities ſuch as are <hi>perſonal.</hi> He took our <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs infirmities</hi> to ſhew the truth of his <hi>humanity.</hi> He took them on himſelf that he might pity us, and might teach us by his holy example how to bear them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> conceived our Saviour by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo ſhe brought him forth into the world. He was born of her. And under this head theſe particulars are to be taken into conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt was born of a woman that was a <hi>pure Virgin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched by man, even when ſhe brought him forth. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be born after a miraculous manner, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.22. <hi>The Lord hath created a new thing in the earth, a woman ſhall incompaſs or incloſe a man.</hi> It is a <hi>new Creation</hi> becauſe wrought in a woman without the help of <hi>man.</hi> The Propheſie in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> muſt be fulfilled, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Behold, a Virgin ſhall conceive, and bear a Son and ſhall call his name Immanuel.</hi> The <hi>Meſſias</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>before</hi> and <hi>under</hi> the Law was to be born of a <hi>Virgin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be of the houſe and lineage of <hi>David.</hi> Of whom the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.30. that he being a Prophet,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66289:54"/> 
                     <hi>knew that God had ſworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins according to the fleſh, he would raiſe up Chriſt to ſit on his Throne.</hi> And it is from many places of Scripture evident and certain, that <hi>Mary</hi> and ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> did lineally deſcend from <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Obſerve the time when Chriſt was born. It was when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was <hi>Emperor</hi> and taxed the <hi>Jews</hi> and all Nations under his dominion, as we find, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Obſerve the place where our Saviour was born. It was in Village of <hi>Judah</hi> called <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that the Propheſie in <hi>Micah</hi> might be fullfilled, <hi>Mich.</hi> 5.2. <hi>But thou Bethlehem, Ephratah, though thou be little among the thouſands of</hi> Judah, <hi>yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in</hi> Iſrael.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let us conſider the <hi>manner</hi> of his Birth, which was very <hi>mean,</hi> namely in the <hi>Stable</hi> of a common Inn.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Obſerve the firſt <hi>tidings</hi> or manifeſtation of his birth, which was made by <hi>Angels</hi> to poor <hi>Shepherds,</hi> Luke 2.10, 11. <hi>And the Angel ſaid unto them. Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the City of</hi> David, <hi>a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord</hi> And thus we have ſhewed how our Lord and Saviour was <hi>born</hi> into <hi>the</hi> World, and became <hi>man.</hi> Before I ſhut up this particular, it will be needful that I ſhew why it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite he ſhould be both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>

                     <hi>humane Nature</hi> of Chriſt being Perſonally united to

                  <p n="3">3. That he might do thoſe great things for us (after he had laid down his life for us) which none but God could do, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>HAving thus ſpoken of our Saviours Birth, and <hi>how he came into the World,</hi> it will be requiſite we ſhould now ſpeak of his <hi>Life,</hi> and how he lived and converſed in this World, which the <hi>Ancient Creed</hi> mentions nothing of, but paſſes immediately from <hi>his being conceived by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>born of the Virgin Mary</hi> to his <hi>ſuffering under</hi> Pontius Pilat. I have in my <hi>Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Four Evangeliſts</hi> fully ſet forth the Hiſtory of the <hi>Life</hi> of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour. Here I ſhall only give a ſhort <hi>Summary</hi> of what I have there more largely delivered, to which I refer my Reader.</p>
                  <p>The Life of our Saviour we have divided into <hi>Six Parts,</hi> and in each <hi>Part</hi> have taken notice of the <hi>Particulars obſervable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt Part</hi> of our Saviours life was from his <hi>Birth</hi> to his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> containing, the ſpace of about Thirty Years. In which we have theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 At Eight days old he was Circumciſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.25.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Mary</hi> the Fortieth day after her delivery goeth up to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> to the Temple to be purified, where ſhe and <hi>Joſeph</hi> preſent the <hi>Child Jeſus</hi> to the Lord according to the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.2, 12, 13. <hi>Mary</hi> preſents the offering for her Purification, <hi>viz.</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a poor Woman) a pair of Turtle Doves, <hi>Levit.</hi> 12.6, 8. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> here acknowledge him and propheſie of him, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. from 22. to 41.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This done, <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> return with <hi>Jeſus</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and there continue for ſome time. For about Two Years after our Saviours Birth, the <hi>Magi</hi> or <hi>Arabian Aſtronomers</hi> who had in their own Country, at our Saviours Birth, ſeen a <hi>ſtrange Star,</hi> or extraordinary brightneſs over <hi>Judea,</hi> and underſtanding either by ſome <hi>Old Propheſie,</hi> or <hi>New Revelation</hi> from God, that it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Birth of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> they being moved by the Spirit, come to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to inquire after the place where this <hi>New King</hi> ſhould be born. They are told by <hi>Herod,</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:66289:55"/> and the Prieſts that the Birth-place of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be at <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem. Herod</hi> bids them go, and inquire for him, and when they had found him, bring him word. They come to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and there finding him do homage to him, and preſent him with gifts. This done, being warned of God not to go back to <hi>Herod,</hi> they return into their own Countrey another way, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. from 1. to 13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. After their departure <hi>Joſeph</hi> is warned by God in a Dream to fly into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo provide for the life of the Child; which accordingly he did, and there <hi>He, Mary</hi> and the <hi>Child</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till <hi>Herod</hi> was dead. But in the mean time <hi>Herod</hi> finding himſelf deceived by the <hi>Magi,</hi> and thinking that this <hi>young Child</hi> had been ſtill at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> or thereabout, that he might be ſure to deſtroy him, he commands all the Male Children from Two years old and under that were in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> or the Coaſts thereof to be killed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. from the 13. to the 19.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Not long after, <hi>Herod</hi> dying, <hi>Joſeph</hi> is warned of God in a Dream to return with the young Child unto the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which accordingly he did, and dwelt in the City of <hi>Nazareth, Mat.</hi> 2 from 19. to the end.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Chriſt at Twelve Years old is brought to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the Paſſover, and there diſputes with the Doctors in the Temple. From hence he went down with his Parents to <hi>Nazareth</hi> again, and there lived privately till his Baptiſm, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. from 41. to the end.</p>
                  <p n="7">.7 <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> being newly entred into his publick Miniſtry, preaches Repentance and Baptizes. He ſharply reprehends ſome of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi> that came to be Baptized of him. He gives particular anſwers to the queſtions of the <hi>People,</hi> of the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicans,</hi> and of the <hi>Soldiers</hi> enquiring what every one of them ought to do. He gives his firſt Teſtimony to Chriſt, preferring him before himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. from 1. to the 18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. from 1. to the 13. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. from 7. to 9.</p>
                  <p>The Second Part of our Saviours life from his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to the <hi>Paſſover</hi> next enſuing containing the ſpace of <hi>half a Year,</hi> in which we have theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He is Baptiz'd by <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and witneſſed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be the Eternal Son of God, and a Second Teſtimony by <hi>John</hi> given of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. from the 13. to the 18. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. from 9. to

                  <p n="2">2. Immediately after his Baptiſm he goes into the Wilderneſs, and is there aſſaulted by Satan with a <hi>Threefold Temptation,</hi> Mat. 4. from 1. to 12. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. from 12. to 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. from 1. to 14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>John</hi> being now Baptizing in <hi>Bathabara,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> come from the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to enquire who he was.

                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt now comes to <hi>John,</hi> whom <hi>John</hi> calls the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> and declares that he was made known unto him to be the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> by the deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt upon him, <hi>John</hi> 1. from 29. to 35.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Upon this Teſtimony Two of <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples follow <hi>Jeſus,</hi> viz. <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh. 1. from 35. to 43.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Chriſt calleth <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> bringeth <hi>Nathanael</hi> to Chriſt, who acknowledges him to be the Son of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. from 43. to the end.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Chriſt worketh his firſt Miracle at a Wedding in <hi>Cana,</hi> where he turns Water into Wine, and prepares to go unto the Paſſover now at hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. from 1. to 13.</p>
                  <p>The Third <hi>Part</hi> of our Saviours life from the <hi>firſt Paſſover</hi> after his Baptiſm to the <hi>Second,</hi> wherein are comprehended the Acts of the <hi>firſt intire Year</hi> of his publick Miniſtry.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. He inſtructs <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> concerning Regeneration and Faith in himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. from. 1. to 22.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples take it ill that Chriſt was more followed than <hi>their Maſter;</hi> from whence <hi>John</hi> takes occaſion to inſtruct them in the difference betwixt <hi>himſelf</hi> and <hi>Chriſt;</hi> whoſe high dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity above himſelf he ſets forth and declares; as alſo what they ſhall have from Chriſt who believe in him; and what they are to expect who believe not in him, <hi>John</hi> 3. from 25. to the end.</p>

                  <p n="37">37. Being asked whether <hi>few ſhould be ſaved,</hi> he exhorts them to <hi>enter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> and to take the <hi>preſent ſeaſon</hi> of grace, from the <hi>Parable of a man</hi> that had invited gueſts, and admitted thoſe who came in due time; but ſhut out the <hi>Loyterers.</hi> He ſhews that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall receive and imbrace the Goſpel, and ſhall enter into the Kingdom of God, whilſt <hi>they</hi> for their impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency ſhall be caſt out, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. from 23. to 31.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. He tells the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who warned him of the great <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> he was in from <hi>Herod,</hi> that he feared him not; for he knew he muſt die at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and then he paſſionately complains of the <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>ſtifneckedneſs</hi> of the People of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and foretels their ruine, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. from 31. to 36.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. He now cures one that had the <hi>Dropſie</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> and juſtifies the ſame. He reproves the ambition of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> ſtriving for the <hi>upper-moſt Seats</hi> at Feaſts, and exhorts them to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. He exhorts them alſo to <hi>feaſt the Poor,</hi> who cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite them, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. from 1. to 15.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. By the <hi>Parable</hi> of a <hi>great Supper,</hi> and the <hi>excuſes</hi> of thoſe that were invited (to ſhift off coming,) he upbraids the <hi>Jews</hi> with their ingratitude; and foretells <hi>their rejection,</hi> and the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Luke 14. from 15. to 25.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. He ſhews that he that will be his <hi>Diſciple</hi> muſt <hi>deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and <hi>all that is dear to him,</hi> and muſt conſider before hand what it may coſt him (as he that intends to build a Tower, or as a King that intends to wage war with another King, muſt do) leſt with ſhame he revolt from him afterwards, and become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unprofitable, like <hi>Salt</hi> that hath loſt its Savour, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. from 25. to 36.</p>

                  <p n="42">42. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> murmur that he coverſed with ſinners. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſhews Gods tender care of the recovery of <hi>loſt ſinners</hi> by three eminent Parables; Firſt, Of the <hi>loſt Sheep.</hi> Secondly, Of the <hi>loſt Groat.</hi> Thirdly, Of the <hi>loſt Son, Luke</hi> 15. whole Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. By the Parable of the cunning though <hi>unjuſt Steward,</hi> he teaches them to make friends to themſelves of the <hi>unrighteous Mammon,</hi> and to be faithful in a right imploying their Temporal Riches. He exhorts them alſo to take heed of <hi>ſerving Mammon,</hi> or ſetting their hearts on Riches. He <hi>reproves</hi> the <hi>Phariſees</hi> for their <hi>Pride, Hypocriſie,</hi> and affectation of the opinion of men. He ſhews that the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> preſcribed by the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law <hi>Typified</hi> and prefigured him, and that the <hi>Prophets</hi> Propheſied of him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>John</hi> came, who declared him to be actually come in the fleſh, and began the <hi>Evangelical Miniſtry.</hi> He declares the permanent Authority of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, which was by the <hi>Phariſees</hi> violated, particularly in the Seventh Commandment. By the Parabolical Hiſtory of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he ſhews the different eſtate of the <hi>Godly Poor</hi> and the <hi>unmerciful Rich</hi> in the other World, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. from 1. to 32.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. He teaches his Diſciples to take heed of giving occaſion of offence and ſcandal, and to forgive thoſe that treſpaſs againſt them, who are ſorry for their offence how oft ſoever they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. from 1. to 5.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. The Diſciples hereupon pray for the increaſe of their <hi>Faith,</hi> that they may depend on him for power to perform this, and his other injunctions. Upon this occaſion he deſcribes the <hi>power of Faith,</hi> and by the Parable <hi>of a ſervant</hi> coming from the ſervice of the Field, and ſetting himſelf to other ſervices after, he declares that a man doth not merit of God, by doing his duty, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. from 5. to 11.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. He healeth <hi>ten Lepers</hi> whereof but <hi>one</hi> returns to give him thanks, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. from 11. to 20.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. He ſhews that his Kingdom comes not with <hi>obſervation</hi> or outward pomp. He ſorewarns them of the days of <hi>Tribulation,</hi> that would come on that Nation after his departure out of this World. He deſcribes <hi>this his coming to execute vengeance on thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate Jews,</hi> viz. That it ſhould be ſuddenly, &amp; would ſurprize them in their deep ſecurity, as it was in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lot.</hi> That there would be much of God's providence ſeen in reſcuing <hi>ſome</hi> fr m that calamity, wherein others would fall, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. from 20. to 38.</p>

                  <p n="48">48. He incourages his Diſciples to <hi>fervency, importunity,</hi> and <hi>perſeverance</hi> in prayer from the Parable of an importunate Widow prevailing with an unjuſt Judge, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. from 1. to 9.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. By a <hi>Parable</hi> of a <hi>Phariſee</hi> and a <hi>Publican</hi> he teaches that God hears and juſtifies the penitent ſinner, and not thoſe which rely on their own righteouſneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. from 9. to 15.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. He now croſſes <hi>Jordan,</hi> and there teaches and heals, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.1.2. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. to 1.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. He anſwereth the <hi>Phariſees</hi> queſtion concerning <hi>divorce,</hi> that the Married may not part but in caſe of Adultery.

                  <p n="52">52. He commands that little Children ſhould be brought unto him, and bleſſeth them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. from 3. to 16. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. from 13. to 17. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. from 15. to 18.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. He anſwers a <hi>rich young man,</hi> who deſireth to know of him, <hi>what he muſt do to inherit Eternal life,</hi> and gives him a <hi>ſpecial command</hi> to go and <hi>ſell all and give to the poor,</hi> to try him and convince him of his ſecret covetouſneſs, who thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts very ſorrowful. Upon this he teaches how hard it is for a rich covetous man who truſts in his riches, to be ſaved. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes them who leave all for his ſake, both <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Eternal recompences:</hi> And to his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (who had done this) he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes high favours at the day of Judgment, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſhall ſit upon Twelve Thrones judging the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Yet he cautions them to be humble minded, and to look to it that they <hi>perſevere,</hi> for <hi>many that are laſt ſhall be firſt, and firſt ſhall be laſt,</hi> Mat. 19. from 16. to 31. Mark 10. from 17. to 32. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. from 18. to 31. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. from 28. to 31.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. Under the <hi>Parable</hi> of an <hi>Houſholder</hi> hiring Labourers at ſeveral hours of the day into his Vineyard, he ſheweth that all ought to be Labourers; that God doth freely both call and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; that none ought to have any confidence in their own works, but a low eſtimation of themſelves, and of whatever they do or ſuffer for him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. from 1. to 17.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. <hi>Lazarus</hi> is now ſick at <hi>Bethany,</hi> and Jeſus is ſent for to him, but for the preſent goeth not, that he might die, and ſo God might be the more glorified in raiſing him to life again, <hi>John</hi> 11 from 1. to 7.</p>

                  <p n="56">56. He acquaints his Diſciples now a <hi>Third time</hi> that he ſhould ſuffer death, and riſe again the Third day; they thereupon diſwade him from going into <hi>Judea,</hi> but he tells them as long as <hi>his day</hi> laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Providence</hi> would ſecure him from danger, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. from 17. to 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. from 32. to 35. <hi>John</hi> 11. from 7. to 11. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. from 31. to 35.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. He gives anſwer to the requeſt of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John, Zebedees</hi> Children, deſiring that they might ſit one on his right hand, the other on his left in his Kingdom. He exhorts them to prepare for <hi>ſufferings</hi> and the Croſs, and commands all of them to be humble minded, and not to ſeek after <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>preheminence</hi> one above another, (remembring that their Office was a <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, not a <hi>Lordſhip</hi> or Dominion) and to imitate <hi>his example</hi> who came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. from 20. to 29. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. from 35. to 46. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. from 24. to 28.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. He now ſets forward towards <hi>Bethany</hi> for the raiſing of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> who was dead. His way lying through <hi>Jerico,</hi> when he came nigh the City he cured a <hi>blind-man. Zacheus</hi> gets up into a Sycamore Tree to ſee him.

He ſhews he was not now preſently (as they thought) to enter upon a Temporal Kingdom, but to die and ſuffer, and ſo go to Heaven; and then to return again in an eminent manner. In the mean time they ought to imploy the Talents he had intruſted them with for his ſervice, and he would reward their diligence. He cures <hi>Two other blind men,</hi> whereof one was <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> as he goes out of the City, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. from 35. to the end. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. from 1. to 28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. from 29. to 35. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. from 46. to 53.</p>

The Chief Prieſts and <hi>Phariſees</hi> call a <hi>Council,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult upon the matter. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> unwittingly propheſies of the fruit of Chriſts death: Here they conclude<note n="*" place="margin">This is the <hi>Firſt Council</hi> at which the <hi>Jews</hi> determined to put our Saviour to death.</note> he ſhall be put to death, but to avoid their fury for the preſent, he withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf privately unto <hi>Ephraim,</hi> John 11. <hi>from</hi> 47. to 55.</p>
                  <p n="61">61. He is inquired for at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by thoſe that came up ſometime before the Feaſt to purifie themſelves, <hi>John</hi> 11. from 55. to the end.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. Six days before the Paſſeover he is entertained at a Supper at <hi>Bethany</hi> by <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Leper,</hi> where <hi>Lazarus</hi> fate at Supper with him. <hi>Mary</hi> pours a box of <hi>precious oyntment</hi> on his head and feet, wiping them with the hairs of her head.

He anſwers that if <hi>they</hi> ſhould hold their peace, the very <hi>ſtones</hi> would cry out. Then coming within the view of the City, he burſt out into tears at the conſideration of their obſtinacy, and their ruine that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue thereupon.

The <hi>Phariſees</hi> are inraged hereat, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. from 28. to 45. <hi>John</hi> 12. from 12. to 20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. from 1.12. <hi>Mark</hi> 11. from 1. to 11.</p>

                  <p n="65">65. Certain Religious <hi>Greeks</hi> deſire to ſee him. They ſpeak to <hi>Philip</hi> about it. Being brought into his preſence, he ſpeaks

                     <hi>SECT. V.</hi> Of our Saviours Death and Burial.</head>
                  <p>WE have now preſented you with a ſhort view of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Life, as alſo with the Hiſtory of his Death. Touching which, theſe things are further to be taken notice of.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>promiſed Meſſias</hi> was to <hi>ſuffer</hi> according to the predictions that went before of him. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 53.4, 5. <hi>Surely he hath born our Griefs, and carried our Sorrows, yet we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God, and afflicted. He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Mark 9.12. <hi>And he anſwered, and told them, how it is written of the Son of man, that he muſt ſuffer many things, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:66289:71"/> be ſet at naught,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.11. <hi>Searching what manner of time the Spirit of Chriſt, which was in them did ſignifie, when it teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified beforehand the Sufferings of Chriſt and the Glory that ſhould follow.</hi> Luke 24.26. <hi>Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things and to enter into his Glory? verſe</hi> 46. <hi>Thus it is written and thus it behoveth Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day.</hi> Acts 26.22, 23. <hi>Having obtained help of God, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue unto this day witneſſing both to ſmall and great, ſaying none other things then thoſe which the Prophets and</hi> Moſes <hi>did ſay ſhould come. That Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and that he ſhould be the firſt that ſhould riſe from the dead, and ſhould ſhew light unto the People, and to the Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As his <hi>Sufferings</hi> in the general were foretold, ſo that he ſhould <hi>Suffer Death</hi> was alſo particularly determined. God had in his all-wiſe Council determined, that <hi>his Son ſhould die for the ſins of men.</hi> The <hi>Serpent</hi> was to <hi>bruiſe the heel of the Womans Seed,</hi> and the ſame ſeed, viz. <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>bruiſe his head,</hi> Gen. 3.15. <hi>And</hi> Acts 4.27, 28. <hi>For of a truth againſt thy holy Child Jeſus, whom thou haſt anointed, both</hi> Herod <hi>and</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>with the</hi> Gentiles <hi>and the People of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were gathered together, for to do whatſoever thy Council had determined before to be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. His <hi>ſuffering Death</hi> was <hi>typified,</hi> 1. By the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> ſlain. 2. By the <hi>brazen Serpent lifted up,</hi> John 3.14. 3. By the <hi>daily Sacrifices, which intimated,</hi> that <hi>without the ſhedding the blood of the Meſſias</hi> there could be no <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins.</p>
                  <p>Let us now conſider in the next place <hi>how</hi> our Saviour Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ancient Creed ſayes, <hi>He ſuffered under Pontius Pilate.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Suffered under Pontius Pilate.</note> But who was this <hi>Pilate? Pilate</hi> was a <hi>Roman,</hi> ſent by <hi>Tiberius</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> to be <hi>Governor</hi> of <hi>Judea.</hi> About ſixty years before our Saviours birth, the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Pompey the Great</hi> were made <hi>tributary</hi> to the <hi>Romans.</hi> For though during the life of <hi>Hircanus</hi> the High Prieſt, and the Reign of <hi>Herod</hi> and his Son <hi>Archilaus,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man State</hi> ſuffered the <hi>Jews</hi> to be Governed by their own <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Governors,</hi> yet when <hi>Archilaus</hi> was baniſhed by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> they received their Governors from the <hi>Roman Emperors,</hi> being made a part of the province of <hi>Syria. Pilate</hi> therefore was <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator of Judea</hi> at this time, and under the <hi>Preſident of Syria</hi> was furniſhed with power of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> The <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> though they condemned our <hi>Saviour</hi> in their own
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66289:71"/> Council as <hi>guilty of death,</hi> yet could not put him to death, the <hi>power of Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> being at this time out of their hands. Therefore they bring him before <hi>Pilate</hi> and vehemently accuſe him before him. <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaw plainly that it was for envy that they thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.18. For when he had examined him he <hi>found no fault</hi> in him touching thoſe things whereof they accuſed him. <hi>Three times</hi> did he challenge the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſhew what evil he had done. <hi>Three times</hi> did he profeſs that he found no cauſe of death in him. His own wife ſent to him this Meſſage, <hi>Have thou nothing to do with that Juſt Man.</hi> And when he heard that our <hi>Saviour</hi> declared himſelf to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> He was then more afraid. Yet at laſt through the vehement clamor and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> (who told him, <hi>if he ſpared him he was not Caeſars friend</hi> (He was prevailed upon (even againſt the light of his own Conſcience) to condemn him to be Crucified. The Hiſtorians of thoſe times acquaint us that this <hi>Pilate</hi> was a very <hi>vile Perſon.</hi> That he was a man of a <hi>high, rough</hi> and <hi>untractable</hi> Spirit; that he brought the <hi>Bucklers</hi> ſtamped with the picture of <hi>Caeſar</hi> into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (which was an abomination to the <hi>Jews,</hi>) and would not for all their <hi>intreaties</hi> remove them, till commanded by <hi>Caeſar.</hi> After that he Seized on the <hi>Corban</hi> or Sacred Treaſury, and ſpent it upon an Aquaeduct; nor could all their importunate Petitions divert his intentions. When the <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> came up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip God at his own Temple, he mingled their blood with their Sacrifies, as we read, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.1. And being a notorious wretch he was afraid of being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the <hi>inſolencies</hi> and <hi>rapines</hi> of his Government, and therefore to content the people, he releaſed <hi>Barabbas</hi> unto them, and delivered <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be Crucified. But though herein he acted againſt all principles of Honeſty and Juſtice, yet he was an inſtrument of fulfilling the determinate Council of God. For the promiſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> (who was to die for our ſins) was to be <hi>crucified</hi> and to <hi>ſuffer upon the croſs.</hi> This was typified by the <hi>braſen Serpent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</note> 
                     <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.9. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs: even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up:</hi> This alſo was Propheſied of our Saviour, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.16. <hi>They pierced my hands and feet.</hi> And Zech. 12 10. <hi>They ſhall look on me whom they have pierced.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now our Saviour was actually condemned and delivered up to that kind of death by <hi>Pilate,</hi> who gave ſentence it ſhould be as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:66289:72"/> the <hi>Jews</hi> required; and they required <hi>he ſhould be Crucified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are <hi>three things</hi> obſervable concerning <hi>Crucifixion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Twas a <hi>painful</hi> death. The hands, and feet (which of all parts of the body are moſt nervous, and conſequently moſt <hi>ſenſible</hi>) were pierced through with nailes, which cauſed a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and tormenting death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Twas an <hi>ignominious</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">'Twas <hi>ſervile ſupplicium.</hi> Thieves and Robbers were uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the <hi>Romans</hi> puniſhed with this kind of death</note> death; and therefore among the <hi>Romans</hi> inflicted upon their <hi>Slaves</hi> and fugitives.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A <hi>curſed</hi> death, as 'tis written, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.13. <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</hi> Having premiſed theſe things let us now conſider what are the inſtructions we ſhould learn from this Article, that <hi>our Saviour was Crucified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt hath hereby redeemed us from the <hi>curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us, Gal.</hi> 3.13. that is, he hath indured that moſt ſhameful death of the Croſs which was accounted <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed,</hi> and <hi>inglorious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt hath <hi>blotted out the hand-writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, and taken it out of the way, nailing it to his Croſs.</hi> One ancient cuſtome (as they tell us) of <hi>Cancelling Bonds</hi> was by <hi>ſtriking a nail through the writing.</hi> Our Saviours Crucifixion hath done this for us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seeing Chriſt was Crucified for us, we ſhould in imitation thereof labour to <hi>Crucifie ſin</hi> in our ſelves. Our <hi>old man</hi> muſt be <hi>Crucified,</hi> that the body of ſin may be deſtroyed. We muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thoſe that are Chriſts muſt <hi>crucifie the fleſh with its affections and luſts.</hi> Gal. 5.24.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſhould often meditate on the <hi>bitter Cup</hi> our Saviour drank, and on thoſe nails that pierced his hands and feet; that ſo we may be the more ready and willing to ſuffer for him. We ſhould conſider how he <hi>humbled himſelf and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs,</hi> teaching us thereby to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves, and with patience to bear the loweſt condition for his ſake; and to imitate him who for the joy that was ſet before him, <hi>endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We come now to the next word in the Creed, <hi>viz. He Dyed.</hi> Our Saviour was not only nailed to the Croſs but <hi>died</hi> thereon. He ſuffered upon the Croſs <hi>a diſſolution,</hi> and died a true and proper death.<note place="margin">Dead</note> He died for our ſins according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66289:72"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. <hi>He was cut off from the Land of the Living,</hi> Iſa. 53.7, 8, 10. <hi>and made his Soul</hi> (that is, his life) <hi>an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for ſin.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my Spirit,</hi> and having ſaid ſo <hi>he gave up the ghoſt,</hi> Luke 23.26.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, Chriſt did <hi>voluntarily</hi> die; for he ſaith, <hi>no man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away my life from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf, John</hi> 10.18. That is, He laid not down his life by a <hi>neceſſary compulſion,</hi> but by a <hi>voluntary election.</hi> He took upon him a neceſſity of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our benefit. But the <hi>Jews</hi> were the <hi>cauſes</hi> of his death, and by <hi>wicked bands crucified him, Acts</hi> 2.23. and <hi>ſlew him and hanged him on a tree,</hi> Acts 5.30. <hi>They</hi> are truly ſaid to have done it, becauſe by their inceſſant importunity they prevailed with <hi>Pilate</hi> to do it. Our Saviour therefore being truly put to death and ſuffering a real diſſolution, let us conſider <hi>what union</hi> was diſſolved by his death and <hi>what</hi> continued. In Chriſt there were <hi>two different ſubſtantial unions. One</hi> of the parts of his <hi>humane nature,</hi> each to other, (in which <hi>his humanity</hi> conſiſted, and by which he was truly man;) the other of his natures <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>humane,</hi> by which it came to paſs that he was both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> in the ſame perſon. Now the <hi>union</hi> of the parts of his <hi>humane nature</hi> was diſſolved on the Croſs, and a real ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made between his Soul and Body. But yet there was no diſunion of either of them from his Deity. The <hi>union</hi> of <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> remained ſtill, nor was the Soul or Body (though ſeparated one from the other) ſeparated from the <hi>Divinity,</hi> but ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained united unto it.</p>
                  <p>When he cried out <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> it intimates no more but that he was bereft of thoſe <hi>joys</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> from the Deity which were neceſſary to aſſwage the bitterneſs of his preſent Agony. Having thus ſhewed that our Saviour <hi>did really die.</hi> Let us now inquire <hi>why it was needful he ſhould die.</hi> 'Twas requiſite for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>new Covenant</hi> or <hi>Teſtament</hi> might be ratified by his <hi>blood. Where a Teſtament is, there muſt needs be the death of the Teſtator,</hi> Heb. 9.16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he might perform that part of his Prieſtly Office which required the ſhedding of his blood. <hi>For without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion,</hi> Heb. 9.22. Therefore Chriſt <hi>our Paſſeover muſt be Sacrificed for us,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7.</p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:66289:73"/>
                  <p n="3">3. If he would redeem us, he muſt give himſelf <hi>a ranſom</hi> for us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. For we being enemies could not be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God but by the death of his Son,</hi> Col. 1.21. <hi>And by his death he hath deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil, Heb.</hi> 2.15. By his death was our redemption wrought, as <hi>by the price</hi> that was paid, as <hi>by the atonement</hi> which was made, as <hi>by the full ſatisfaction</hi> that was given, that God might be reconciled to us, who was before offended with us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</note>Thus we have ſeen what our Saviour died on the Croſs. And as he really died by the ſeparation of his Soul from his Body, ſo his body was carried and laid up in a Sepulchre, hewn out of the Rock in which never man was before laid. This the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi> do ſufficiently teſtify. Now that <hi>the Meſſias</hi> was to be <hi>buried</hi> was typified by <hi>Jonas, who was three dayes and three nights in the Whales belly.</hi> And accordingly <hi>the Son of Man</hi> was to be <hi>three days and three nights in the heart of the earth,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">He is ſaid to be three dayes and three nights in the Grave, the <hi>whole time or ſpace of three dayes</hi> being put for a <hi>part</hi> of it, by a ſynecdoche ſee my Harm. <hi>Ch. 6. pag. 266.</hi>

                     <hi>nor ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption,</hi> Iſay. 53.9. <hi>He was cut off out of the land of the living. He made his Grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death,</hi> Chriſt being put to death, his body was by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimathea</hi> begged of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and by him and <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> (one of their great Council) taken down and wound in fine linnen with ſpices (as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Jews</hi> was to bury) and laid in a <hi>new Sepulchre</hi> in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den nigh the place of his execution, and a great ſtone rolled to the door of the Sepulchre, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.60. Thus <hi>the deſign</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> made <hi>his Grave with the wicked,</hi> intending he ſhould be buried with <hi>them</hi> who were crucified with him. But the <hi>deſign of Heaven</hi> placed him with <hi>the rich</hi> in his death, and cauſed a <hi>Councellor</hi> and a <hi>Ruler</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> to bury him. So that we may interpret that place of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> thus, <hi>He was buried nigh to the wicked, yet with the rich when he was dead.</hi> Our Saviour notwithſtanding the malice of the <hi>Jews</hi> being thus <hi>honourably buried.</hi> The <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> deſired of <hi>Pilate,</hi> that the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> might be made ſure, leſt his Diſciples ſhould ſteal him away. which was accordingly done, the Stone being ſealed with the

                  <p>We come now to conſider what improvement we are to make of this Article.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then ſeeing Chriſt did really <hi>die</hi> and was <hi>buried,</hi> let us te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie our communion with him in <hi>his death,</hi> by dying unto Sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In <hi>his Burial,</hi> by the burial of the old man.</p>

Beſides, the torments of the damned are ſurely ſuch as theſe, 1. <hi>Remorſe of Conſcience</hi> or <hi>the never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying worm.</hi> 2.

This they pretend. 1. To prove and that from three places of Scripture. And 2. To aſſign the <hi>ends</hi> for which he did thus deſcend. We ſhall examine both. <hi>Firſt</hi> They ſay, that though theſe words are not <hi>formally</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Scriptures, that <hi>Chriſt deſcended into Hell,</hi> yet they are contained <hi>virtually</hi> in them, which they will prove. 1. From <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Now that he aſcended, what is it but that he alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, firſt into the lower parts of the earth?</hi> by which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Hell.</hi> For anſwer, <hi>by the lower parts of the earth,</hi> I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive is meant, <hi>the earth it ſelf,</hi> which is the <hi>loweſt part</hi> of the World, as <hi>Heaven</hi> is the <hi>higheſt.</hi> For before Chriſt could aſcend unto Heaven, it was neceſſary he ſhould deſcend to the Earth by his incarnation, but there was no neceſſity of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending into Hell. And further, the <hi>Grave</hi> may be called one of the <hi>lower parts</hi> of the earth in oppoſition to the <hi>ſurface</hi> or <hi>upper part</hi> of it, on which we live. And this is all that ſeems to be meant in this place. 2. They pretend to prove it from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. where 'tis ſaid, that Chriſt <hi>being put to death in his humane nature, was quickned or raiſed up again by the power of his Spirit or God-head, by which he preached to the Spirits in Priſon,</hi> whence they infer that he <hi>deſcended into Hell</hi> to preach to the <hi>Spirits</hi> there in torments. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> From theſe words it
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:66289:74"/> appeareth. 1. That Chriſt preached in the dayes of <hi>Noah by the ſame Spirit,</hi> by the vertue and power of which, he was raiſed from the dead. But <hi>that Spirit</hi> was not his <hi>Soul</hi> but ſomething of a greater power. 2. thoſe to whom he preached were <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi> all that time, <hi>the long-ſuffering of God</hi> waited for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and return, while the Ark was preparing. And 3. <hi>Their Souls</hi> or <hi>Spirits,</hi> for their <hi>diſobedience,</hi> are now in Hell, and for refuſing of that mercy that was offered to them by the preaching of Chriſt. 'Tis true indeed, this was not performed by an immediate act of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> as if he had perſonally appeared on earth and actually preached to the old world, but it was performed by the Miniſtry of <hi>Noah</hi> (who was guided and inſpired by his Spirit) and accordingly is called <hi>a preacher of Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. The third place they alledge for the maintenance of their opinion is, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.25, 26, 27, (a place that relates to Pſal. 16.10.) <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore (ſay they) ſurely Chriſts Soul did <hi>locally deſcend into Hell.</hi> I <hi>Anſwer, Soul</hi> is ſometimes taken <hi>properly</hi> only for the <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> of a man, ſometimes improperly, for the <hi>whole perſon</hi> as Acts 27.37. <hi>We were in the Ship two hundred three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ſixteen Souls.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> There is no ground to believe that the <hi>Souls</hi> of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> or other Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons, that died before the coming of Chriſt, were kept in <hi>any place below,</hi> which can be called <hi>hell</hi> or <hi>limbus Patrum. Abraham</hi>'s <hi>boſom</hi> ſurely was in the <hi>Heavens above,</hi> far from any region where the Devil, and his Angels were. <hi>Elias</hi> was carried up <hi>in a Chariot to Heaven;</hi> and our Saviour ſayes, <hi>Many ſhall come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac and Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob in the Kingdom of Heaven, Matth.</hi> 8.11. And ſurely the Kingdom of Heaven is no region of Hell. This alſo muſt be remembred, that Chriſts death was <hi>efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous</hi> for the Salvation of <hi>Believers</hi> before his coming as well as ſince, he being a <hi>Lamb ſlain</hi> (in the <hi>decree of God</hi>) from the beginning.

                  <p n="2">2. Others ſay that the end of our Saviours deſcent into Hell was <hi>to triumph over Satan, and all the powers below, within their own dominions.</hi> And the places of Scripture they bring to prove it are <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14 15 <hi>He blotted out the hand-writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66289:75"/> the way, nailing it to his Croſs: And having ſpoiled Principalities and Powers he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</hi> And Epheſ. 4.8. <hi>Wherefore he ſaith, when he aſcended up on High, he led Captivity Captive and gave gifts unto men.</hi> I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> From theſe two places of Scripture no more can be proved than this, that Chriſt triumphed over <hi>Principalities and Powers</hi> at his death upon the Croſs, and led <hi>Captivity Captive</hi> at his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into Heaven. And if the places be well weighed, I believe they will be ſo far from proving that Chriſt deſcended into Hell to triumph there, that they will appear more proper to perſwade the contrary. For why ſhoud he go to <hi>Hell</hi> to triumph over <hi>them,</hi> over <hi>whom</hi> he had triumphed on the Croſs? And why ſhould he go to <hi>Captive that Captivity</hi> then, which he was to lead Captive when he aſcended into Heaven? And further, in vain ſhall we pretend that Chriſt deſcended into Hell to <hi>lead Captivity Captive</hi> if we withal maintain, that when he deſcended thither, he brought none away that were Captive there. And for his triumphing over his enemies in Hell, ſurely the Prophet <hi>David</hi> intended no ſuch thing when he ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.26, 27. <hi>Therefore did my heart rejoyce and my tongue was glad becauſe thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell.</hi> He ſpeaks of it as a matter of joy and gladneſs, as a matter of great benefit not to be left there. But can it be accounted a benefit or matter of joy to any one not to be left or permitted to ſtay in <hi>that place</hi> to which he came pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely that he might triumph over his adverſaries, whom he had conquered? ſurely no. So that there ſeems not to be any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to aſſign <hi>either of theſe</hi> for the <hi>ends</hi> of his ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed deſcent. But to come cloſer to the matter, none need trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves to find out <hi>ends</hi> why our Saviour ſhould deſcend thither, ſeeing there is no expreſs place in the Scripture where the Holy Ghoſt ſayes, that <hi>Chriſt did deſcend into Hell,</hi> the place of the damned. The <hi>four Evangeliſts</hi> that wrote the Hiſtory of our Saviour make no mention of his going to any ſuch place. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2. mentions Chriſts <hi>Death, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> but not a word of his deſcent into Hell. This was no part of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> Preached. And for the further clearing of this matter, let us conſider theſe things. 1. His <hi>God-head</hi> could not deſcend, being every where preſent as we ſaid before. 2. His <hi>Body</hi> was laid in the Grave.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66289:76"/> 3. His Soul went not to <hi>Hell,</hi> but immediately to <hi>Paradiſe</hi> the place of joy and bliſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. <hi>This day</hi> (ſayes our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the penitent Thief) <hi>ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> Theſe things being <hi>premiſed</hi> I ſee not that <hi>this article</hi> of <hi>Chriſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent</hi> can be underſtood of <hi>his Soul</hi> either <hi>metaphorically</hi> or <hi>really.</hi> Others therfore underſtood it of his <hi>body.</hi> And here alſo is ſome difference. For ſome by Chriſts <hi>deſcending into Hell</hi> underſtand only <hi>his burial,</hi> becauſe in thoſe <hi>Creeds</hi> where this Article of <hi>Chriſts deſcent</hi> was expreſſed, there is no mention of his Burial, but it is wholly omitted. Thus the <hi>Athanaſian Creed, who ſuffered for our Salvation, deſcended into Hell, roſe again</hi> the third day <hi>from the Dead.</hi> And <hi>Ruffinus</hi> tells us, that though the <hi>Oriental</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Creeds had not theſe words in them, that <hi>Chriſt deſcended into Hell,</hi> yet they had the ſenſe of them in the word <hi>Buried.</hi> By which it appears that the <hi>firſt intention</hi> of putting theſe words into the Creed was to expreſs <hi>the burial of our Saviour,</hi> and the <hi>deſcent of his body</hi>

Where the Apoſtle ſhews us that <hi>David ſeeing this before, ſpake of the Reſurrection of Chriſt; that his Soul was not left in Hell, neither did his fleſh ſee corruption.</hi> Chriſt himſelf did foretell it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.22.23. <hi>The Son of man ſhall be betrayed into the hands of men, and they ſhall kill him, and the third day he ſhall be raiſed again.</hi> And John 2.19. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this Temple</hi> (viz. of my Body) <hi>and in three days I will raiſe it up.</hi> Chriſt had ſo plainly and ſo often foretold his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> could ſay to <hi>Pilate, Sir, we remember that this Deceiver ſaid while he was yet alive, after three days I will riſe again.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.23. <hi>that he ſaid no other things then what</hi> Moſes <hi>and the</hi> Prophets <hi>did ſay ſhould come,</hi> viz. <hi>that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer</hi> and that he ſhould <hi>riſe from the Dead.</hi> And as Chriſts Reſurrection was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of, ſo it was <hi>typified</hi> and <hi>prefigured.</hi> 1. By <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 22. who was bound, and laid on the Altar, and as good as <hi>dead</hi> in his Fathers account, yet <hi>Abraham</hi> received him from the dead again in a figure, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.19. that is, in a figure of Chriſts Reſurrection. 2. By <hi>Jonas,</hi> Matth. 12.40. as <hi>Jonas was three days and three nights in the Whales belly,</hi> ſo ſhall the Son of man be <hi>three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth.</hi> 2. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord did ſo riſe as was foretold. The Lord of Life was buried on that day on which he was Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and his body was in the grave <hi>ſome part of</hi> that day, and <hi>all the next day, and ſome part of the day following.</hi> And very early on the <hi>firſt day</hi> of the week he aroſe. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to whom he ſhewed himſelf alive after his paſſion <hi>by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny infallible proofs gave witneſs of his Reſurrection,</hi> Acts 1.3. <hi>He being ſeen of them forty days, and ſpeaking of the things, pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</hi> And our Saviour himſelf after his Reſurrection, ſaid to his Apoſtles, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39, 40. <hi>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my ſelf, handle me and ſee, for a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones, as ye ſee me have; and when he had thus ſpoken, he ſhewed them his hands and his feet.</hi> 3. For a further proof of his Reſurrection, let us conſider the manner
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:66289:77"/> of it, and his ſeveral <hi>Appearings</hi> after it. 1. Very early on the firſt day of the week with a <hi>great Earthquake</hi> our Lord aroſe, and an Angel deſcending rolled away the ſtone, and ſate thereon. The watchmen are frighted away. 2. <hi>Mary Magdalen, Joanna, Mary</hi> the mother of <hi>James</hi> with others, come to the Sepulchre with ſpices prepared to embalm him. The Angel ſpeaks to them not to be affraid, but to come and ſee where <hi>Jeſus</hi> had been laid, but was now riſen. He bids them go tell his Diſciples that in <hi>Galilee</hi> they ſhould ſee him. 3. The women go and tell the ſame to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but their words ſeemed to them as idle tales. 4. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> run to the Sepulchre and ſee the linnen cloaths in which <hi>Jeſus</hi> was wrapped; but his body was not there. They return home wondring: but <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> ſtill ſtayed there weeping, and looking back ſhe ſaw <hi>Jeſus;</hi> yet thought it had been the <hi>Gardner,</hi> but upon his ſpeaking to her ſhe diſcerned that it was <hi>He.</hi> This was his firſt appearing after his Reſurrection.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                     </note> She goes to imbrace his feet, which he forbids, but ſends her to tell his Diſciples, (whom he calls his Brethren;) which ſhe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly does, but they believe her not. The other women run to the Sepulchre to try if they likewiſe could ſee him; and being there told by the Angel that he was riſen, <hi>Chriſt</hi> meets them in the way and ſayes <hi>All-Hail,</hi> and ſends them to his Brethren to tell them they ſhould meet him in <hi>Galilee.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                     </note> This is his <hi>ſecond appearing.</hi> The affrighted watchmen who had fled into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and had acquainted the Chief Prieſts with all that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, have <hi>money</hi> given them to ſay that his Diſciples ſtole him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way while we ſlept. But how miſerable a fiction was this? For if they had ſtoln his body away, (which yet they did not) could they have put life into it?<note place="margin">3. <hi>Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

Two Angels appearing to them, aſſure them that he will ſo come to Judgment as they had ſeen him go to Heaven. And thus much for our Saviours ſeveral appearings after his Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let us conſider how our Saviour aroſe. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe of his Reſurrection was <hi>God himſelf.</hi> For no other power then that which is <hi>Omnipotent</hi> can raiſe the dead, as the Apoſtle intimates, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.32. <hi>This Jeſus hath</hi> God <hi>raiſed up,</hi> Eph. 1.19, 20. <hi>according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead and ſet him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.</hi> This great work is attributed to the Father, but not to him alone; For to whomſoever that <hi>infinite power</hi> doth belong, by which Chriſt was raiſed; <hi>That Perſon muſt be acknowledged to have raiſed him.</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:66289:78"/> The <hi>Son</hi> of God therefore being of the <hi>ſame eſſence</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>of the ſame</hi> power with the Father, and <hi>the ſame</hi> being true alſo of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> we muſt accordingly acknowledge that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt raiſed up Chriſt from the dead. <hi>John</hi> 2.19, 21. Jeſus ſaid unto them, <hi>deſtroy this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and in three-days I will raiſe it up, he ſpake of the temple of his body</hi> So that not only <hi>God the Father</hi> raiſed the Son, but alſo <hi>God the Son</hi> raiſed <hi>himſelf,</hi> by the power of <hi>his Divinity,</hi> which was never ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated after his incarnation either from his Body or his Soul.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let us conſider <hi>the time</hi> when he aroſe, <hi>viz.</hi> on the <hi>third day</hi> from his paſſion. This was foretold of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> not only that he ſhould riſe again, but that he ſhould ariſe the <hi>third day</hi> after his death, it was typified by <hi>Jonas</hi> as we ſhewed before. Our Saviour did riſe <hi>properly</hi> on the <hi>third day</hi> after his death; and he was three days and three nights in the heart of the earth, <hi>ſynecdochically</hi> the <hi>whole time</hi> or ſpace of <hi>three dayes</hi> being put for a <hi>part</hi> of it. Our Saviour roſe the <hi>firſt day of the Week:</hi> and <hi>his Reſurrection</hi> being ſo eminent a declaration, that he had fully accompliſhed the work of our Redemption, from thence the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was changed to <hi>that day. Acts</hi> 20.7. <hi>And upon the firſt day of the Week, when the Diſciples came together to break bread,</hi> Paul <hi>preached unto them.</hi> 1 Cor. 16.1. <hi>As I have Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the Churches of Galatia ſo do ye. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the firſt day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in ſtore, as God hath proſpered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.</hi> He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains that their <hi>Collections</hi> for the poor Saints and <hi>oblations</hi> ſhould be on that <hi>day.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> ſayes Rev. 1.10. <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day.</hi> Thus the obſervation of the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day</hi> of the week, which the <hi>Jews</hi> kept, did ceaſe and was buried with our Saviour. And the obſervation of <hi>that day</hi> on which <hi>the Son of God roſe,</hi> by the practice of the bleſſed Apoſtles was tranſmitted to the Church of God, and ſo hath continued in all ages of the Church ever ſince. As God ſpake by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Exodus 31.13. <hi>Verily my Sabbaths ye ſhall keep, for it is a ſign between me and you. viz.</hi> that you profeſs your ſelves to be my people in an eſpecial manner. So they that belong to the Church of Chriſt are known by obſerving the <hi>firſt day of the week,</hi> on which he aroſe, and by this mark (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) are diſtinguiſhed from ſuch who own not Chriſt nor his Goſpel.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:66289:79"/>
                  <p n="6">6. And laſtly, Let us conſider the ends for which Chriſt aroſe? And thoſe were ſuch as theſe, 1. for our <hi>juſtification.</hi> Rom. 4.25. <hi>He was delivered for our offences and roſe again for our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> 2. To aſſure us of our <hi>reſurrection.</hi> If Chriſts body had not been raiſed, how could we have expected the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our bodies? The Reſurrection of the <hi>members</hi> depends upon the Reſurrection of the <hi>Head.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14. 3. That he might be declared to be <hi>the Son of God with power, Rom.</hi> 1.4. by his Reſurrection from the dead. Therefore ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.32.33. <hi>We declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promiſe which was made unto the Fathers, God hath fulfilled the ſame unto us their Children, in that he hath raiſed up Jeſus again, as it is alſo written in the ſecond Pſalm. Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> Chriſt was the Son of God before, but then he appeared ſo to be againſt all contradiction. For he aroſe by his own divine power, which no meer man ever did or ſhall do. 4. He roſe again to encourage us firmly to believe in him as a moſt <hi>perfect Redeemer.</hi> Our <hi>Surety</hi> is releaſed and ſet free, therefore Gods Juſtice is ſatisfied, and ſo we are <hi>begotten unto a lively hope of eternal life by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. 5. By his Reſurrection he hath ſhewed us how we ought to imitate him and to riſe from the <hi>death of Sin to the life of Grace.</hi> This the Apoſtle intimates to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm into death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father; even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life.</hi> Let us conſider therefore and ſeriouſly examine our ſelves whether we be riſen with Chriſt or no? Are our affections ſet on things above? <hi>Acts</hi> 3.2. Do we delight in the Ordinances of God? (They that have a ſpiritual life will delight in that food whereby that ſpiritual life is maintained.) Do we delight in communion with God, and exerciſe our ſelves in frequent meditation and the believing views of the Glory of the other life? Thoſe who are riſen with Chriſt <hi>ſeek the things that are above.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe words of the <hi>Creed</hi> are theſe. <hi>He aſcended into Heaven, and ſitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty.</hi> In treating of <hi>this Article</hi> I ſhall firſt ſhew that the promiſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to <hi>aſcend into Heaven.</hi> 2. That our Jeſus did really and truly aſcend thither. 3. I ſhall ſhew what <hi>Heaven</hi> it was he aſcended into. 4. The reaſons of his Aſcenſion. 5. The time when he aſcended. 6. The place from whence he aſcended.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the <hi>Firſt,</hi> namely, that the promiſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to aſcend into Heaven. This was typified of him by the <hi>High Prieſts</hi> going once a year into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> Heb. 9.11. <hi>which was a type of Heaven.</hi> The <hi>High Prieſt</hi> when he had ſlain the Sacrifice, did with the blood thereof enter into the <hi>Holy of Holies.</hi> So the <hi>Meſſias</hi> having offered up himſelf a Sacrifice to God for us with his own blood, went into the <hi>Holy of Holies, viz.</hi> into <hi>Heaven,</hi> there to intercede for us by the virtue and merit of that blood. And as this was typified, ſo it was alſo propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> Pſal. 68.18. compared with Epheſians 4.8. <hi>Thou haſt aſcended up on high, thou haſt led Captivity Captive, thou haſt received gifts for men.</hi> He was to conquer <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> and triumphing over them, he was to aſcend to the higheſt Heaven, and thence to ſend the precious and glorious gifts of the Spirit unto the Sons of Men. And accordingly he himſelf did foretell his Aſcenſion, <hi>John</hi> 6.62. and <hi>John</hi> 20.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This was not only foretold of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but really perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by him. He who was the <hi>Eternal Son of God,</hi> and by his Divinity preſent in Heaven while here upon the Earth, did by local tranſlation of his humane nature, really and truly aſcend from this earth below into the Heavens above, as is ſufficiently teſtified by theſe following Scriptures, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.50, 51. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9, 10. Chriſts Aſcenſion was viſibly performed in the ſight of his Apoſtles. They ſaw him when he aſcended;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:66289:80"/> the holy Angels there preſent bearing alſo Teſtimony unto it, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us conſider the place he aſcended unto, which was the <hi>Heaven of Heavens,</hi> he paſſed through all the regions of the air, through all the coeleſtial Orbs, till he came to the Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the moſt glorious preſence of the Majeſty of God. He aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far above all viſible Heavens to the <hi>third Heaven,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. that he might <hi>fill all things,</hi> that is, <hi>fulfill all things prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us conſider the reaſons why he aſcended.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Having finiſhed the work of our Redemption, it was meet he ſhould return thither from whence he came, <hi>John</hi> 16.28. <hi>John</hi> 17.4, 5. 2. After his <hi>Humiliation</hi> his <hi>Exaltation</hi> was to follow. The firſt ſtep of which was his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and his <hi>Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> another ſtep of it. 3. Chriſt by his Aſcenſion manifeſted his victory over Sin, Satan and Death. 4. He Aſcended to make interceſſion for us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. 5. That he might ſend down a more plentiful effuſion of the gifts and graces of his Spirit. And accordingly he tells his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. <hi>Nevertheleſs, I tell you the truth, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for you that I go away, for if I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you.</hi> John 7.38, 39. <hi>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water. But this ſpake he of the ſpirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive, for the Holy-Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified.</hi> 6. He aſcended that he might prepare a place for his members. John 14.2. <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many Manſions, if it were not ſo I would have told you: I go to prepare a place for you,</hi> Heb. 6.20. <hi>Whither the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner is for us entred even Jeſus made an High Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedeck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. We come to conſider the <hi>time</hi> when he aſcended, <hi>viz.</hi> forty dayes after his Reſurrection, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. The reaſons why he continued ſo long, we may ſuppoſe to be theſe two. 1. to confirm unto his Diſciples his Reſurrection, and aſſure them of the truth of it; and, 2. To inſtruct them in the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Let us conſider the place from whence he aſcended, <hi>viz. Bethany,</hi> that part of <hi>Mount Olive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> which was near <hi>Bethany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:66289:80"/>
                  <p n="7">7. Let us conſider how he aſcended, <hi>viz.</hi> while <hi>he bleſſed his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> he was parted from them. And <hi>while they beheld, a Cloud received him out of their ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We come now to conſider what improvement we ought to make of this Doctrine. 1. Chriſts aſcenſion confutes the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine of <hi>tranſubſtantiation.</hi> He is not really and corporally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Sacrament. He is not there, for <hi>he is aſcended into Heaven.</hi> 2. It makes for our conſolation. It may ſerve to encourage us to go to God in all our neceſſities, ſeeing we have ſo powerful an <hi>advocate</hi> at Gods right hand. 3. Seeing Chriſt is aſcended, it may aſſure us that if we be his members we ſhall aſcend alſo. The <hi>head</hi> being aſcended, the members muſt likewiſe in due time aſcend. <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father, I will that thoſe alſo whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>aſcenſion</hi> of true Believers as a thing already effected by Chriſts aſcenſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6. <hi>And hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in Heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> that is, having by that power by which he raiſed Chriſt from the grave, <hi>quickned</hi> us and beſtowed a new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life upon us, he hath alſo (in <hi>aſſured hope) raiſed us up from the dead</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Head,</hi> and hath ſet us with him in Heaven. For <hi>He</hi> ſitting there who is our <hi>Head,</hi> we who are his members may at preſent not unfitly be ſaid to fit there alſo in him, and ſhall infallibly come thither in due time. 4. It may take away the <hi>fear of death,</hi> yea, make it deſirable to us, if we be members of Chriſt, ſeeing it will but carry us thither, whither he is gone before to prepare a place for us. Therefore the Apoſtle ſayes <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. that though he was in a ſtrait betwixt two whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould deſire to die or live, conſidering the need the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> and others had of his Miniſtry; yet as for himſelf he had a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is far better than to continue in this World.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>promiſed Meſſias</hi> was to <hi>ſit on the right hand of the Father.</hi> This was foretold Pſal. 110.1. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand untill I make thine enemies thy footſtool.</hi> That thoſe words were ſpoken concerning the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> may appear from <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.44. and <hi>Acts</hi> 2.34, 35.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Our Meſſias</hi> after his aſcenſion did ſit at the right hand of God, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.19. <hi>He was received up into Heaven and ſate on the right hand of God.</hi> This was an honour never promiſed, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver given to any but the <hi>Meſſias, Heb.</hi> 1.13. <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid he at any time ſit on my right hand?</hi> The Angels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſtand about the Throne of God, but never any of them ſate down on his right hand. But our Saviour was ſo aſſured of this honour, that before the <hi>Chief Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> when he ſaw his death contrived, and his Croſs prepared, he expreſſed his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.69. <hi>Hereafter ſhall the Son of man ſit on the right hand of the power of God.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him after his Aſcenſion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. ſayes <hi>Who is gone into Heaven and is on the right hand of God, Angels and authorities and powers being made ſubject unto him.</hi>

'Tis true, God being a Spirit hath no material parts, no <hi>right hand</hi> or <hi>left hand;</hi> but he is pleaſed to condeſcend to our capacities, and to ſpeak to us after the manner of men, among whom the <hi>right hand</hi> is the moſt honourable place. Thus 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.19. <hi>Bathſheba</hi> was placed on <hi>Solomons right hand.</hi> The <hi>right hand</hi> of God muſt therefore be taken here <hi>metaphorically,</hi> not <hi>properly.</hi> And ſo it ſignifies. 1. The great honour given to Chriſt. 2. The great Power and Dominion he hath obtained in Heaven. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports his <hi>Kingly Power,</hi> and it was his ſolemn entry upon his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal office</hi> as to the execution of that full dominion which was due unto him. <hi>For worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain to receive Power and Riches and Wiſdom and Strength and Honour and Glory
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:66289:81"/> and Bleſſing, Rev.</hi> 5.12. Therefore he ſaid after his Reſurrection, <hi>all power is given to me in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> Mat. 28.18. And the Apoſtle tells us Phil. 2.8, 9. <hi>To him every knee ſhall bow,</hi> that is, that all ſhould be ſubject to him. The principal end of this <hi>Regal Office</hi> of Chriſt is the effectual Redemption and actual Salvation of all thoſe whom God hath given him. And <hi>whoſoever,</hi> or <hi>whatſoever</hi> oppoſeth their Salvation, is <hi>by that oppoſition,</hi> become his enemy. And ſeeing the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of God cannot be <hi>evacuated,</hi> our Saviour muſt exerciſe this his <hi>Regal Power</hi> at the right hand of God till all ſuch enemies be ſubdued, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. <hi>For he muſt reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</hi> And when the whole Office of the <hi>Mediator</hi> ſhall be compleated and fulfilled, then every branch of the execution ſhall ceaſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 28. <hi>Then cometh the end when he ſhall have delivered up the Kingdom to God even the Father, when he ſhall have put down all Rule and all Authority and Power, and when all things ſhall be ſubdued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, then ſhall the Son alſo himſef be ſubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</hi> But though the Mediatorſhip of Chriſt be then reſigned, and the <hi>Regal Office,</hi> as a part of that Mediatorſhip; yet Chriſt ſhall not ceaſe to be <hi>King</hi> or looſe any thing of that power and honour he had before; but as the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> has it, <hi>His Kingdom ſhall have no end.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Let us encourage our ſelves if we belong to him, to expect <hi>protection</hi> from him. God hath given him to be <hi>head over all things to his Church.</hi> And all power is given him both in heaven and earth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us remember his interceſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>For Chriſt is not entred into the Holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> 1 John 2.1. <hi>If any man ſin we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous.</hi> Heb. 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt, all that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> Doth the guilt of ſin ſting and wound our Conſciences?

                  <p>The Scripture holds forth to us a twofold Judgment to come.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. A <hi>General,</hi> Judgement at the end of the World, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of which may appear to us from theſe Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the ſence that even <hi>natural conſcience</hi> ſeems to have of it. <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. and as <hi>he reaſoned of Righteouſneſs, Temperance and Judgment to come,</hi> Foelix <hi>trembled.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God which requires it. Here <hi>Barabbas</hi> a murderer is releaſed and Chriſt is Crucified; here Judgment is often perverted, and the Righteous oppreſſed. But there is a Judgment to come that will ſet all things ſtreight.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the clear and manifeſt <hi>declaration</hi> of the will of God

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p n="4">4. By being willing to deny our ſelves for his ſake and to take up his Croſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By duly regarding his <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> and their Meſſage, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.40.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. Having prepared our ſelves for our tryal, let us watch for our Summons to appear before this great Judge. And ſo much of the firſt uſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Doctrine may ſerve for <hi>conſolation</hi> to the Righteous. 'Tis a fountain of great comfort to all the people of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. Let them conſider that he will reward them for all the works and faithful ſervices they have done for him in this life. Here they have performed many ſecret duties that no eye hath ſeen; there is a time coming, <hi>when he that ſees in ſecret will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them openly,</hi> ſuch or ſuch a ſervice they have done for God; the thing poſſibly in it ſelf but ſmall (as the Widows mite) but it was performed with much love and deſire to pleaſe God, and much ſingleneſs of heart; ſuch a ſervice ſhall not go unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let them conſider, that though here they they lie under many <hi>ſcandals</hi> and reproaches for the name of Chriſt and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p>IN ſpeaking to this <hi>Article,</hi> it will be requiſite that I 1. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe this, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>each Perſon</hi> in the ſacred Trinity is to be <hi>believed in</hi> by us, and we are thankfully to accept the <hi>mercies</hi> that are conferred by each Perſon, and to labour to perform the <hi>duties</hi> we owe to each of them diſtinctly. For as to take God <hi>for our God</hi> is more than barely to believe that <hi>there is a God;</hi> and to take Chriſt for our <hi>Saviour,</hi> is more than barely to believe <hi>that he is the Meſſiah:</hi> ſo to <hi>believe in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is not barely to believe that he is the <hi>third Perſon</hi> in the Trinity, and <hi>truly God,</hi> but to take him for our <hi>Guide, Sanctifier, Helper, Advocate and; Comforter.</hi> 2. We are to know that he is called the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> becauſe of <hi>all the three Perſons</hi> his peculiar office is, to <hi>Sanctifie</hi> and make <hi>Holy</hi> the Church and people of God. And therefore the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>that God had choſen them to Salvation through the Sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.</hi> There are ſome that ſay, they <hi>believe in the Holy Ghoſt</hi> and that <hi>he Sanctifies them, and all the elect people of God,</hi> and yet reject all his <hi>Sanctifying motions,</hi> and hate all thoſe that are <hi>Sanctified by him,</hi> making them the objects of their ſcorn. There are others of <hi>another ſtrain</hi> who <hi>enthuſiaſtically</hi> plead the authority of the Spirit <hi>in themſelves</hi> againſt the <hi>authority</hi> of the Spirit ſpeaking <hi>in the Holy Scriptures.</hi> But let us take heed of both theſe. That therefore I may ſpeak pertinently to this Article, I ſhall ſhew that we muſt labour 1. Rightly to underſtand the <hi>Doctrine of the holy Spirit.</hi> 2. <hi>Our duty towards him.</hi> The <hi>Doctrine</hi> concerning the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> (which is to be believed by us) we have in part already explained in the Section concerning the <hi>Trinity,</hi> viz. Sect. 2. of Chap. 1. Wherein we have ſhewed</p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:66289:86"/>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Holy Ghoſt is a <hi>Perſon,</hi> not a <hi>meer quality, energy</hi> or <hi>operation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he is a <hi>Divine Perſon,</hi> and has <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature with the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> and ſo is God <hi>truly,</hi> and <hi>properly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he is a <hi>Perſon diſtinct</hi> from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That he is a Perſon <hi>proceeding</hi> both from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi> We ſhall now in ſome more particulars ſhew what is further to be <hi>known</hi> and <hi>believed</hi> concerning this bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This <hi>holy Spirit</hi> infallibly inſpired both the Prophets of old, and alſo the Holy Apoſtles and Evangeliſts firſt to preach, and and then to write the Doctrine of Chriſt, which is contained in the holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ſame bleſſed Spirit <hi>ſetled</hi> this holy Doctrine, and the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of thoſe holy men, by many <hi>miracles</hi> and wonderful works, which he enabled them to work, by which they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the unbelieving World, and plant the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This ſame bleſſed Spirit having conſtituted the <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> of the Church, he doth qualifie and fit men with requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite gifts for their <hi>ſtated ordinary miniſterial work</hi> (which is to explain and apply the foreſaid Scriptures, and adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and guide and govern the Flock) and doth aſſiſt them in a diſcharge of their Office.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This ſame bleſſed Spirit is Chriſts <hi>advocate</hi> with men, and does by the word <hi>illuminate</hi> their minds, and <hi>ſanctifie</hi> and <hi>renew</hi> their wills, and draws them to Chriſt, to reſt on his great <hi>propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. This ſame holy Spirit alſo aſſiſteth the <hi>Sanctified</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of <hi>Grace given them,</hi> as in the exerciſe of <hi>Repentance, Faith, Obedience, and Selfdenial.</hi> He alſo directs and governs their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, inabling them to walk <hi>watchfully,</hi> that they may not diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God nor their holy profeſſion. For <hi>if we live in the Spirit (being quickned by his renovation) we muſt alſo walk in the Spirit,</hi> following his directions; and if <hi>we walk in the Spirit we ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the Fleſh.</hi> And as many as are thus <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> they <hi>are the Children of God,</hi> Gal. 5.25.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He teacheth us to pray, and guides us, and directs us in our prayers and devotions, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. and

The <hi>moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of this bleſſed Spirit do alwayes tend to our good, and to drive us to God, and to obey his holy Will and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and never to tranſgreſs any of his precepts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt take heed of <hi>quenching the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. (that is, the <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>graces</hi> of the Spirit in our ſelves) but muſt labour to ſtir them up by <hi>prayer</hi> and the <hi>due exerciſe</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt take heed of <hi>grieving this bleſſed Spirit.</hi> Eph. 4.30. Not that he can properly be grieved; but he is ſaid to be <hi>grieved</hi> when we do that which in it ſelf is apt to grieve him, if he were capable thereof; and which provokes him to do <hi>that</hi> which <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved perſons</hi> uſe to do, namely to withdraw his gracious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting preſence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt not neglect the means the Spirit hath appointed us to uſe for our improvement in Sanctification. We muſt attend upon <hi>him</hi> and expect him in his own ways, and not in wayes wherein he uſeth not to go.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We muſt <hi>do moſt</hi> when this bleſſed Spirit helps us <hi>moſt.</hi> If he extraordinarily help us at any time in prayer, we ſhould not break off ſo ſoon as at other times.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We muſt be very thankful for the aſſiſtances he is pleaſed at any time to afford us. And above all, if he hath <hi>convinced</hi> us of the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> of our <hi>ſins,</hi> hath wrought in our hearts true Godly ſorrow and contrition for them, and a real hatred and loathing of them, and hath drawn our hearts to Chriſt Jeſus, to ſeek pardon and reconciliation with God <hi>in</hi> and <hi>through</hi> his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:66289:88"/> and Interceſſion, and hath begun a work of Sanctification in us, then we ought to admire and to be for ever thankful for the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>efficacious</hi> grace of this <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi>

                  <p>THat which we are bound to believe concerning the <hi>Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi> is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt hath a Church upon the earth, which for the <hi>latitude</hi> and extent thereof may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Catholick,</hi> and for the <hi>Piety</hi> of the Profeſſors thereof may be called <hi>Holy.</hi> In the treating of which, I ſhall ſpeak. 1. Of the <hi>name.</hi> 2. Of the <hi>nature</hi> of the Church. 3. Of the <hi>diſtinctions</hi> of it. 4. Of the <hi>notes</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>name. Church</hi> is a name not found in all the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Old Teſtament, in which the body of Gods people is repreſented to us after a figurative manner of Speech, by the names of <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Pſal. 87.2. <hi>The Lord loveth the Gates of Zion more then all the dwellings of Jacob,</hi> and Pſal. 112.6. <hi>Pray for the peace of Jeruſalem; they ſhall proſper that love thee.</hi> The name <hi>Church</hi> occurreth not till the time of the Goſpel, and then it was impoſed by our Saviour. For no ſooner had <hi>Peter</hi> made this confeſſion for himſelf and the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God, Mat.</hi> 16.16. but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently our Saviour adds, <hi>upon this Rock</hi> (that is, the rock of this <hi>confeſſion,</hi> or upon <hi>this Truth</hi> whereof thou haſt made profeſſion) <hi>will I build my Church.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> or <hi>this Faith which thou haſt profeſſed,</hi> ſhall be the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of Believers, eſpecially the <hi>object</hi> of this faith and confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.

                     </gap> which ſignifies <hi>coetum evocatum,</hi> a choſen or ſelected company, a company called forth of the world or choſen out of others to profeſs <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> and to worſhip the true God according to his will. And hereby is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the <hi>body collective</hi> of all Gods people profeſſing <hi>Faith in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:66289:88"/> Chriſt,</hi> though made up of ſeveral particular Congregations, which have been called by the grace and goodneſs of God to a participation of his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> and other outward means of eternal life. The <hi>Church</hi> therefore in the language of the New Teſtament doth alwayes ſignifie a <hi>company of perſons profeſſing faith in Chriſt. Single perſons ſo profeſſing,</hi> are members of the particular Churches to which they appertain. And all thoſe <hi>particular Churches</hi> are members of the <hi>univerſal or Catholick Church,</hi> which is one by unity of <hi>aggregation,</hi> not only of <hi>many perſons,</hi> but alſo of <hi>many Congregations</hi> of <hi>believing</hi> and <hi>baptiſed</hi> perſons. The Church is therefore <hi>one,</hi> though the members be many; And there are ſeveral things wherein the members of the Catholick Church do agree, and ſeveral things alſo wherein they differ. The things wherein they differ are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The members of the Church are not all of the ſame age or ſtanding in Chriſt. Some are <hi>Babes,</hi> ſome <hi>Young</hi> men, and ſome are <hi>Fathers,</hi> 1 John 2.12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are not all of the ſame degree of ſtrength. Some are of ſmall ſtrength, and have need to be fed with <hi>milk</hi> and not with <hi>ſtrong meat.</hi> Some are <hi>weak in Faith</hi> and apt to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whom the <hi>ſtronger</hi> muſt take heed of offending. Some are of ſounder underſtandings, and others are tainted with errors and corrupt opinions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They have not all the ſame degree of gifts, nor the ſame ſort of gifts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are not all of the ſame uſefulneſs and ſerviceableneſs to the Church. Some are as <hi>Pillars, Gal.</hi> 2.9. Some are fit to be teachers of others, ſome ſo live that the Church hath much benefit by their lives, and great loſs by their deaths. And ſome are ſuch troublers of it by their weakneſſes and corrupt diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that their death is ſome eaſe to the places where they did live.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are not all the ſame in regard of office. Some are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be <hi>Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, Overſeers</hi> and <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the myſteries of God,</hi> and to <hi>feed the flock,</hi> and to be their <hi>Rulers in ſpiritual things.</hi> And ſome are the <hi>Flock,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to learn of them and to have them in honour and high eſteem for their works ſake, and to obey them. As there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of gifts, ſo alſo of offices.</p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:66289:89"/>
                  <p n="6">6. They have not all the ſame imployment. The <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> work is of <hi>one</hi> kind and the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>another.</hi> There is <hi>one</hi> ſort of duties belongs to <hi>Parents,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> to <hi>Children,</hi> one to <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſters,</hi> and another to <hi>Servants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. All the members of the Church are not to be equally ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and loved. Even among the <hi>Elders</hi> there are ſome that are worthy of <hi>double honour.</hi> Some are of high and excellent gifts and graces; and as more of God doth ſhine forth in them, ſo a greater love and honour is due to them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The members of the Church will not have all an equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of glory, there being a great inequality in their graces and the ſervices they have done for God in this World.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much of the things wherein the members of the Church do <hi>differ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us conſider what are the things wherein they <hi>agree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The members of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> (ſtrictly taken as comprehending only the true living members thereof) have all <hi>one God,</hi> the fountain of their <hi>being</hi> and <hi>happineſs,</hi> and are all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to him as <hi>Children</hi> to <hi>one Father,</hi> Eph. 4.6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They have all one <hi>Head, Redeemer, Saviour,</hi> and <hi>Mediator,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, to whom they are all united.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They have all one <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> dwelling in them, illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſanctifying and guiding of them, and are all animated by this one Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They have all one <hi>principal ultimate end,</hi> which is the glory of God and their own eternal Salvation, which they all aim at, hope for, and expect. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They have all <hi>one Goſpel</hi> which teaches them the knowledge of Chriſt, and the things appertaining to their Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. 'Tis <hi>one kind of Faith</hi> that by <hi>the holy Doctrine</hi> is wrought in their Souls, though the <hi>degrees</hi> be various: and in the <hi>main eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi> of Chriſtianity they uſually agree, though in <hi>leſſer things</hi> there is ſometimes much difference among them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is <hi>one new diſpoſition</hi> or <hi>holy nature</hi> wrought by the ſpirit of God in them all. And the affections predominant in them have <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame object. Sin</hi> is the chiefeſt thing that all of them hate; the <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> of God is the chief thing they all fear; and <hi>God in Chriſt</hi> is the prime object of all their loves.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They have all one <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>law</hi> to live by. The <hi>moral Law</hi> is to them all a <hi>rule of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:66289:89"/>
                  <p n="9">9. They are all entred into <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame Covenant</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> and to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up ſincerely to the ſervice of God the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. They agree in a <hi>ſpecial love</hi> to the whole Church, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of its <hi>welfare.</hi> And though there may be ſome differences (through miſtake) between ſome particular members, yet they deſire and pray for the ſafety of the whole.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. They agree in their love to all the Ordinances and <hi>inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted means of Grace,</hi> and make uſe of them in order to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in holineſs.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of the things wherein the members of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi> do <hi>agree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We come to conſider the <hi>nature</hi> of this Church. There are <hi>two things</hi> by which the <hi>nature</hi> of this Church may be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from ſuch other <hi>publick Aſſemblies</hi> which may ſeem to lay claim to <hi>this title.</hi> 1. <hi>Holineſs.</hi> 2. <hi>Catholiciſm</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality.</hi> Now this Church may be called <hi>Holy.</hi> 1. In reſpect of its <hi>vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> All the members hereof are called <hi>unto,</hi> and engaged unto Holineſs. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity.</hi> The end of Chriſts gathering them out of the World to be his people is, that they may be <hi>holy</hi> and a <hi>peculiar people to himſelf, zealous of good works.</hi> Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Congregation of Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 7.6. <hi>Thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God.</hi> That is, they were ſo <hi>by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination</hi> and <hi>engagement,</hi> though many of them were not <hi>really ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> 2. The Church may be called <hi>holy,</hi> becauſe it trains up people in the wayes of <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>godlineſs.</hi> 3. It may be called <hi>holy</hi> in reſpect (though not of the <hi>greater</hi> yet) of the <hi>better part</hi> of it, whom God hath ſanctified by the graces of his holy Spirit. The other <hi>Attribute</hi> of the Church is <hi>Catholick. Catholick</hi> as it is not in the Scriptures, ſo was it not anciently in the Creed, but inſerted by the Fathers of the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan Council.</hi> It ſignifies <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal.</hi> Now the Church is called <hi>Catholick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of <hi>place.</hi> It being not now ſhut up in the narrow bounds of <hi>Judea,</hi> but diffuſed through the World. 2. In reſpect of <hi>perſons.</hi> All ſorts of perſons being promiſcuouſly called to <hi>Faith in Chriſt.</hi> Neither <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Gentile,</hi> neither <hi>bond</hi> nor <hi>free</hi> being excluded, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. 3. In reſpect of times; It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending

                     <hi>all the Faithful</hi> that have been in all times and ages ever ſince the giving of the <hi>firſt promiſe</hi> [that <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head.] And</hi> to <hi>our Saviours dayes;</hi> and ſince then to the age in which we live, and is to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue from hence by a continual acceſſion to the end of the world. Nay it doth not only include that part of the Church is now <hi>militant</hi> on earth, but <hi>that</hi> alſo which is <hi>triumphant</hi> in Heaven. Both <hi>they</hi> with us and we with them make <hi>one body myſtical,</hi> whereof Chriſt is the Head. And <hi>all together,</hi> together with the antient <hi>Patriarches</hi> and other holy men of God, which lived under the Law, do make up that <hi>one glorious Church,</hi> which is called in the Scriptures, the <hi>general Aſſembly, the Church of the firſt born, whoſe names are written in the Heavens.</hi> Heb. 12.23. <hi>Catholick</hi> then the Church may be called in regard of <hi>extent,</hi> whether we conſider <hi>time, place</hi> or <hi>perſons.</hi> 4. In reſpect of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> becauſe it maintains the <hi>Catholick Doctrine, quae</hi> ſemper, <hi>quae</hi> ubique, <hi>quae</hi> abomnibus <hi>credita eſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Adverſus Haereſes c. <hi>3</hi>
                     </note> as <hi>Lirinenſis</hi> (d) ſayes, which hath <hi>allwayes,</hi> and <hi>in all places,</hi> by <hi>all ſorts of real Chriſtians</hi> been received as <hi>Orthodox. Catholick</hi> in this ſence is the ſame with <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and a <hi>Catholick Chriſtian</hi> the ſame with a <hi>true profeſſor.</hi> A private Chriſtian may be called <hi>Catholick</hi> in this ſenſe. And thus the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the pureſt times made uſe of this word <hi>Catholick</hi> to diſtinguiſh themſelves from <hi>Hereticks,</hi> according to that famous ſaying of <hi>Pacianus; Chriſtianus mihi nomen eſt, Catholicus cognomen. Chriſtian</hi> (ſaith he) is my name, and <hi>Catholick</hi> my ſir-name. By the <hi>one</hi> I am known from <hi>Infidels,</hi> by the <hi>other</hi> from <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> And ſo long as the main body of Chriſtians retained the <hi>form of wholſom words, and kept the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> it ſerved fitly for a <hi>diſtinctive mark</hi> to know an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi> Profeſſor from an <hi>Heretical.</hi> But when the main body of the Church was once torn in pieces, and every <hi>leading faction</hi> would be thought the <hi>true Church</hi> of Chriſt, they took to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the name of <hi>Catholicks</hi> alſo. And thus our great Maſters in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have appropriated to themſelves the name of <hi>catholicks,</hi> accounting all men <hi>Hereticks</hi> that differ from them, and do not hold <hi>communion</hi> with them in their errors. And then they defend themſelves by the name of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> from having dealt unjuſtly with their fellow Chriſtians, men every way <hi>more Orthodox</hi> than themſelves. But let them talk what they will, the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:66289:90"/> Church which is <hi>truly Catholick</hi> containeth within it all thoſe Congregations, which are <hi>truly the Churches of Chriſt.</hi> And all perſons whatſoever who are true Chriſtians belong to it. So that whoſoever is not of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> cannot be of the <hi>true Church,</hi> out of which <hi>ordinarily</hi> there is no Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I come now to the <hi>diſtinctions</hi> of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Church of Chriſt may be conſidered either as
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Militant</hi> or</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Triumphant.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church <hi>Militant</hi> is that company of Chriſtians here on earth who are in warfare, warring againſt <hi>Satan,</hi> the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Church <hi>Triumphant</hi> are thoſe <hi>Saints</hi> who having van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed and overcome thoſe adverſaries, do now reign and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in Heaven. This diſtinction is founded upon <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.14, 15. Where the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of whom the whole Family in heaven and earth is named.</hi> The <hi>Family</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> is the <hi>Church Triumphant.</hi> The Family on Earth the <hi>Church Militant:</hi> of which the Apoſtle himſelf was <hi>one</hi> when he ſaid 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the Faith.</hi> The <hi>Triumphant</hi> we may read of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9. <hi>After this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all Nations, and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues, ſtood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloathed with white Robes, and Palms in their hands.</hi> Having thus premiſed this diſtinction of the Church <hi>Militant</hi> and <hi>Triumphant.</hi> I come now to ſpeak particularly of the <hi>Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then we muſt know that the <hi>Churcrh Militant</hi> here on earth conſiſts partly of <hi>ſuch</hi> as are <hi>truly</hi> of it, partly of <hi>ſuch</hi> as only in reſpect <hi>of their outward profeſſion</hi> belong to it. As the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.9. of ſome who profeſſed themſelves <hi>Jews, I know the Blaſphemy of them that ſay they are Jews and are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan:</hi> ſo we may ſay of ſome who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, that they are very far from being <hi>ſuch</hi> in truth and reality. For <hi>prophane</hi> perſons and <hi>hypocrites</hi> are rather <hi>in</hi> the Church than <hi>of</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Militant Church</hi> is either <hi>viſible</hi> or <hi>inviſible.</hi> The <hi>viſible

The <hi>inviſible Church</hi> conſiſts of ſuch as <hi>truly are</hi> what they <hi>profeſs themſelves to be.</hi> It is called <hi>inviſible</hi> becauſe it is not viſible to the eyes of men.

All <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as Chriſtians who profeſs and hold the <hi>eſſentials</hi> of Chriſtianity are the <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal</hi> Church. And <hi>all Congregations</hi> conſiſting of <hi>lawful Paſtors,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian people,</hi> aſſociated for perſonal communion <hi>in the worſhip of God,</hi> and <hi>holy living,</hi> are <hi>particular true Churches,</hi> though <hi>they</hi> may alſo much differ <hi>in degrees of purity.</hi> This is the <hi>univerſal Church,</hi> as upon earth. Otherwiſe, as I ſaid before, the <hi>univerſal Church</hi> comprehends both the Saints on <hi>Earth</hi> and the Saints in <hi>Heaven.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> moſt abſurdly affects to be called the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> yea <hi>Roman Catholick. Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> imports the <hi>univerſal</hi> Church, and <hi>Roman</hi> but a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi> The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> was once indeed an <hi>eminent part,</hi> (yet but a part) of the <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Church. But now ſhe is <hi>ſo degenerate</hi> and <hi>corrupt,</hi> that ſhe is termed <hi>Babylon.</hi> Rev. 1.7. And the people of God are commanded to come out of her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>And I heard another voice from Heaven ſaying, come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues,</hi> Did the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Apoſtles
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:66289:91"/> dayes worſhip Images? Did it pray to <hi>Saints?</hi> Did it pray for the Dead? Did it perform its Divine Worſhip in an unknown tongue? Did it withhold the Cup from the Laity? Was this the Primitive practice of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> I ſuppoſe the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> themſelves will not aſſert it. We can make it appear that we hold the <hi>ſame Faith that was of old delivered to the Saints,</hi> and that <hi>we</hi> have not departed farther from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> than <hi>they</hi> have departed from <hi>this Faith</hi> and the truth of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Yet the <hi>Papiſts</hi> notwithſtanding uſe to ask us, <hi>where was your Religion before Luther?</hi> To which we anſwer wherever there were any true and real Chriſtians before <hi>Luther,</hi> among <hi>them</hi> was our Church. This is the Church we profeſs our ſelves of. And ſurely there were many more more Chriſtians at that time in the world then thoſe that were in the Cummunion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Tis true Chriſtianity that makes any to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and members of the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> it is not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>inferiour truth</hi> that doth ſo; neither doth <hi>every error</hi> caſt a man out of it. That <hi>Church</hi> then which comprehended <hi>all the true Chriſtians</hi> in the World is the Church we were of before <hi>Luther.</hi> We do not confine the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> to any Sect or Party. <hi>Proteſtants</hi> we hold are the ſoundeſt part of this Church, but not the <hi>whole Church.</hi> All within the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that are <hi>true Chriſtians</hi> we allow to be of this Church. And the ſame we ſay of the <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Ethiopians, Abyſſines,</hi> or any other profeſſing Chriſtianity. And though the <hi>Papiſts</hi> talk much of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> if they will try whether <hi>their</hi> Doctrine or <hi>ours</hi> be the <hi>ſounder,</hi> we are willing to appeal to <hi>Antiquity.</hi> Let the eldeſt way of Religion carry it. We are of a Religion that is not leſs then ſixteen hundred years old. For we hold the Doctrine delivered by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, which they have ſhamefully departed from. But the <hi>Papiſts</hi> farther ask us, If their Church be not the <hi>true Church,</hi> what is become of our <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> who died in the Communion of <hi>their Church?</hi> We anſwer, They might live and die in the Communion of that Church and yet be free from many of the groſs errors in it. And God might graciouſly paſs by their ignorance and weakneſs, who had not ſo great a light as we have to ſhew them the error of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. We do therefore in Charity think, that ſome of our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors</hi> formerly, and ſome of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> at this day who hold and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:66289:92"/> believe the <hi>main Articles</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and do live <hi>good lives</hi> according to their knowledge, may be ſaved; but not by their <hi>Popery,</hi> but by their <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus much of the diſtinctions of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I come now in the laſt place to ſpeak of the notes of the Church, which are theſe three. 1. True and ſound Doctrine preached. 2. Right adminiſtration of the Sacraments. For as thoſe are more or leſs purely adminiſtred, ſo the Church is more or leſs pure. 3. Obedience to Chriſt and his Doctrine. <hi>Diſcipline</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is neceſſary for the preſervation of the Church, in purity of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Manners;</hi> yet it belongs not to the <hi>very being,</hi> but to the <hi>well being</hi> of it. But here a queſtion may ariſe. <hi>How is the Church ſaid not to erre? Anſw.</hi> 1. The <hi>whole</hi> doth not erre, though ſome particular Church may. 2. The Church doth not erre <hi>univerſally</hi> though in <hi>ſome points</hi> of Doctrine it may, which are not <hi>eſſential</hi> or fundamental to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Let us now conſider what improvement we are to make of this Article.</p>

This ſhews us the admirable priviledge of every <hi>truly rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſanctified</hi> perſon, who is moſt certainly a <hi>member</hi> of the <hi>true Catholick Church.</hi> All <hi>true Chriſtians</hi> are <hi>Catholicks</hi> in a better ſenſe than the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> uſe that word.

                  <p n="1">1. By the tenure of the Goſpel we ſhall find that thoſe are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly <hi>Saints,</hi> who being <hi>called with an holy calling,</hi> have not been diſobedient to it, but are indued with a <hi>holy faith</hi> uniting them to Chriſt, and are <hi>purified</hi> thereby, and are Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the <hi>holy Spirit of God,</hi> and by vertue thereof do lead a holy life, daily endeavouring to <hi>perfect holineſs</hi> in the fear of God; ſuch perſons are really and truly <hi>Saints;</hi> and being true members of the Church of Chriſt are, the proper ſubject of this Article.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Who are <hi>thoſe perſons</hi> with whom <hi>theſe Saints</hi> have <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?</hi> and in <hi>what</hi> doth <hi>this their communion</hi> conſiſt?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Saints of God living in the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with <hi>God the Father,</hi> praying unto him and praiſing of him, truſting in him, and exerciſing ſuch acts of worſhip as he requires, 1 John 1.3. <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They have <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>God the Son,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.9. <hi>God hath called us to the fellowſhip of his Son.</hi> For being united to Chriſt by faith, they are thereby made partakers of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:66289:93"/> and receive ſpiritual life and grace from him for the ſanctifying of their natures, and ſincerely endeavour after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p>This is the <hi>communion</hi> which the Saints enjoy with the three bleſſed perſons in the Trinity, John 14.23. <hi>If any man love me</hi> (ſayes our Saviour) <hi>he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> And the <hi>preſence of the Spirit</hi> cannot be wanting where <hi>theſe two</hi> are inhabiting; for <hi>if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> therefore with the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> inhabiteth in the Saints. For <hi>know ye not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.16.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Saints of God living here in the Church of Chriſt have <hi>communion</hi> with the <hi>Holy Angels. They are Miniſtring Spirits</hi> for our good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>They</hi> rejoyce at the <hi>Converſion of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. They</hi> do many good offices for the people of God, which poſſibly they are not ſufficiently ſenſible of. And this their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry is exerciſed (as 'tis probable) about the <hi>ordinary concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of our lives, and not in ſome extraordinary caſes only.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Saints of God living in the Church of Chriſt have communion with all the Saints departed out of this life, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the preſence of God.

And 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the <hi>Saints triumphant</hi> wiſh to the <hi>Saints militant</hi> the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they enjoy, and poſſibly pray for them in general, though their particular caſes they may not know. But we are not to think (as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> fondly conceive) that they interpoſe their merits for us, and that for this cauſe we are to invocate them, or perform any Religious worſhip towards them. Theſe are but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of mans brain, wanting warrant from the word of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Saints of God living in the Church of Chriſt have

And another Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>By one Spirit they are are all baptized into one body.</hi> So that they have communion one with another in theſe offerings, 1.

According to their places and calling they <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>admoniſh</hi> one another. 3. They endeavour to walk <hi>by the ſame Rule,</hi> and to mind <hi>the ſame things</hi>

                  <p>Having thus opened the nature of this Article, let us now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what are the inſtructions we ſhould learn from it?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we believe <hi>this communion of Saints,</hi> which hath been before deſcribed, then let us ſeriouſly conſider whether we have a part and ſhare in it or no. There are many inſtead of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>with God</hi> and <hi>with Chriſt,</hi> have communion with Satan, and inſtead of communion with Saints have communion with the ungodly and wicked, and joyn with them in the practice of iniquity, in ſwearing, ſwaggering, drinking, revelling, and ſcoffing at Saints and Saintſhip; and this they account and call good fellowſhip. But let no man deceive himſelf. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. That <hi>God is light, and in him there is no darkneſs at all. If we ſay that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lye and do not the truth. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we have a ſhare and part in this communion, it ſhould inflame our hearts with an ardent love to all that are within this communion. If ſimilitude of <hi>ſhape</hi> or <hi>feature</hi> will beget a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if <hi>congruity</hi> of <hi>manners</hi> and <hi>diſpoſition</hi> will unite affections, what great love ſhould there be among all the <hi>Saints</hi> who have the ſame image of God ſtamped upon them, and are acted by
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:66289:94"/> the ſame ſpirit? Surely all that are true members of Chriſt ſhould heartily deſire and pray for the welfare of all their fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And ſhould have their hearts touched with the miſeries that befall either the Church of Chriſt in general, or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular members thereof. See <hi>Amos</hi> 6.6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A belief of this Article ſhould teach us, that as we are to do good to all in our ſeveral places and according to our abilities, ſo eſpecially to thoſe who are of the <hi>houſhold of Faith.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Let us conſider <hi>what are the kinds of Sin.</hi> Sin is either <hi>original</hi> or <hi>actual.</hi> 1. <hi>Original Sin</hi> is by the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Articles deſcribed to be <hi>a fault and corruption of the nature of every man that naturally is engendred of the off-ſpring of</hi> Adam, <hi>whereby man is very far gone from original Righteouſneſs and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto evil.</hi> In which deſcription <hi>three</hi> things may be obſerved. 1. <hi>Original</hi> ſin is the <hi>corruption of the nature of every man</hi> deſcended from the loins of <hi>Adam.</hi> 2.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66289:94"/> Righteouſneſs</hi> wherewith the Lord enriched <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>our ſelves</hi> in him. 3. 'Tis an inclination to evil. So that the whole race and off-ſping of <hi>Adam,</hi> who were then <hi>radically, ſeminally,</hi> and <hi>potentially</hi> in his loins, were infected with this contagion. As the Scripture ſayes of <hi>Levi,</hi> that he <hi>paid tythes in</hi> Abraham <hi>to</hi> Melchiſedec, Heb. 7.9, 10. <hi>For he was then in the loyns of his Father</hi> Abraham <hi>when</hi> Melchiſedec <hi>met him.</hi> So all we and the whole race of Mankind were in <hi>Adam</hi> when he loſt himſelf.

                     </note> and <hi>depravation of nature,</hi> is plain and manifeſt from theſe Scriptures, Pſal. 51.5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity and in ſin did my mother conceive me,</hi> Epheſ. 2.3. <hi>And were by nature the children of wrath even as others.</hi> And that even <hi>Infants</hi> themſelves are tainted with this <hi>original corruption</hi> may appear from this, that they are liable to death. Now <hi>Death</hi> is a <hi>wages</hi> no way due to Infants for <hi>actual</hi> ſins (for actually as yet they have not offended) therefore there muſt need be in them ſome <hi>original guilt,</hi> ſome <hi>birth-ſin,</hi> which makes them liable to death. 2. <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſin,</hi> (which is the fruit of original) is any <hi>action</hi> or <hi>commiſſion</hi> or any <hi>omiſſion</hi> repugnant unto the Law of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us conſider the wages of ſin. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. laſt. <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> The <hi>wages, due reward,</hi> and <hi>fruit</hi> of ſin is death. But <hi>life eternal</hi> is the fruit of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, not as its <hi>wages,</hi> but as a <hi>gift</hi> freely given by God, upon the account of the <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>interceſſion</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt. Every ſin therefore being a deviation from the Law of God, brings us under guilt; and guilt makes us liable to ſuffer the puniſhment which is due to our ſins, and proportional to our offences. And our offences are augmented by the conſideration of the dignity of the perſon againſt whom they are committed. And being committed againſt God, muſt therefore needs be very heinous, and bind us over to ſuffer <hi>eternal puniſhment,</hi> except we obtain a pardon, and our ſins be remitted.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us conſider <hi>by whom ſins are remitted.</hi> 1. <hi>Men</hi> may forgive offences committed againſt them, ſo far forth as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.3, 4. <hi>If thy brother treſpaſs againſt thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, forgive him, and if he treſpaſs againſt thee ſeven times in a day, and ſeven times in a day turn again to thee, ſaying, I repent, thou ſhalt forgive him.</hi> But as <hi>Sin</hi> is a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66289:95"/> tranſgreſſion of Gods Law, ſo God only can forgive it. 2. 'Tis God the <hi>Fathers</hi> Prerogative to forgive Sins. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 43.25. <hi>I even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſion for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> 3. God communicated this power to his <hi>Son,</hi> while he was here on the earth, who had <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of forgiving ſins</hi> as part of <hi>that power</hi> that was given him both in Heaven and Earth, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.5. and 7. <hi>When Jeſus ſaw their Faith he ſaid unto the ſick of the Palſie, Son, thy ſins be forgiven thee:</hi> The Scribes ask <hi>who can forgive ſins but God only?</hi> Their <hi>poſition</hi> was good, that God only can forgive ſins, but their <hi>ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> falſe, that Chriſt was a <hi>meer man,</hi> and not <hi>God</hi> as well as Man. 4. <hi>Miniſters</hi> may forgive ſins not <hi>authoritatively,</hi> but <hi>Miniſterially,</hi> and <hi>declaratively.</hi> They preach remiſſion in Chriſts name, &amp; declare what perſons they muſt <hi>be,</hi> and what they muſt <hi>do,</hi> who ſhall obtain it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let us conſider upon what account and for <hi>whoſe ſake</hi> ſins are forgiven. The external <hi>impulſive cauſe</hi> inclining God to pardon us our ſins and treſpaſſes, is the reſpect he hath to the <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> and <hi>ſufferings</hi> of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. that <hi>we are juſtified freely by the grace of God</hi> (as by the <hi>internal impulſive cauſe</hi> of our juſtification, by which he was firſt moved to forgive us our ſins,) and then <hi>through the redemption wrought by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>external moving</hi> or impulſive cauſe of ſo great a mercy. The death of Chriſt is the <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> of our forgiveneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. <hi>For this is my blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins,</hi> Epheſ. 1.7. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins, according to the riches of his grace,</hi> Acts 13.38, 39. <hi>Be it known unto you therefore men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins. And by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified, by the Law of</hi> Moſes, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>And the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> Rev. 1.5. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him that loved us and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood.</hi> God is indeed ſaid to remit <hi>our ſins,</hi> but never to remit the <hi>price,</hi> without which we had never been redeemed. The <hi>Law</hi> promiſed life but upon <hi>perfect, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, uninterrupted obedience,</hi> and the voice thereof was, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> But this we failed in; we need therefore the <hi>interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Sacrifice of Chriſt for us. The <hi>atonement</hi> made by
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66289:95"/> the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> under the Law, clearly had relation to the <hi>death of the Meſſias,</hi> and whatſoever <hi>vertue</hi> was in them, did operate through <hi>his death</hi> alone. As he was a <hi>Lamb</hi> ſlain from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world in Gods decree, ſo all <hi>atonements</hi> which were ever made, were only effectual through his blood. So that <hi>no ſin</hi> was ever forgiven but by vertue of that <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> and God was never <hi>reconciled</hi> to any ſinner, but by <hi>intuition</hi> of that <hi>propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</hi> Yet the general doctrine of remiſſion of ſins was never clearly revealed, and publickly preached to all Nations, till the coming of our Saviour in the fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Let us conſider what <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins doth import,</hi> and contain in it. <hi>Forgiveneſs of Sins</hi> doth comprehend in it <hi>reconciliation</hi> of an <hi>offended</hi> God, and a <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> made to a <hi>juſt</hi> God. It contains <hi>reconciliation</hi> (without which God cannot be conceived to remit;) It comprehendeth ſatisfaction, without which God was reſolved not to be reconciled. Chriſt by his death hath reconciled God unto us, who was before offended by our ſins. His <hi>death</hi> was <hi>ordained</hi> to be a <hi>propitiation</hi> for us, and to render God <hi>propitious</hi> to us. The puniſhment which Chriſt endured was a <hi>full ſatisfaction</hi> to the Will and Juſtice of God. <hi>He gave his life a ranſome for many,</hi> Matth. 20.28. Now a <hi>ranſome</hi> is a <hi>price</hi> given to redeem ſuch as are any way in captivity, or <hi>any thing laid down by way of compenſation</hi> to take off an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby <hi>he</hi> who was before <hi>bound,</hi> becometh <hi>free.</hi> Chriſt bought us, and the <hi>price</hi> he paid for us was his <hi>own blood,</hi> and <hi>that blood</hi> was a full and perfect ſatisfaction unto God. And as the <hi>offence</hi> is augmented (as we ſaid before) by the <hi>dignity</hi> of the perſon, againſt whom the offence is committed, ſo the <hi>value</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> of <hi>that</hi> which is given by way of compenſation is <hi>enhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> according to the <hi>dignity of the perſon</hi> who makes <hi>that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</hi> If therefore we conſider on <hi>our ſide</hi> the nature and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of ſin, and on <hi>Chriſts ſide</hi> the ſatisfaction made and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation wrought, we ſhall eaſily perceive how <hi>God forgiveth Sins,</hi> and in <hi>what</hi> the <hi>remiſſion</hi> of them conſiſteth. Chriſt taking upon him the <hi>nature of man</hi> and offering himſelf a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to God for <hi>mans</hi> ſin, giveth that unto God (<hi>for,</hi> and <hi>inſtead</hi> of the <hi>everlaſting puniſhment</hi> due to man,) which is more <hi>valuable</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> unto God than <hi>that puniſhment</hi> could be, and ſo maketh a ſufficient compenſation and ſatisfaction to God for the ſins of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66289:96"/> man. Which ſacrifice God accepting, releaſes the <hi>offence,</hi> and becomes reconciled unto man (He performing the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons required of him) and for the puniſhment which Chriſt endured, taketh off mans obligation to eternal puniſhment. And in <hi>this act</hi> of God conſiſteth the forgiveneſs of ſins.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Let us conſider what is required of them, who may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this great <hi>priviledge</hi> and <hi>bleſſedneſs, the remiſſion of all our ſins.</hi> The things required of them are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>True Repentance.</hi> Of which ſee Chap. 2. of the ſecond part of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> 2. <hi>Faith in Chriſt.</hi> Of which ſee Chap. 3. of the ſame Treatiſe. 3. <hi>Sincere obedience unto Chriſt.</hi> Heb. 5.9. <hi>He is the author of eternal Salvation to all that obey him.</hi> 4. <hi>A readineſs and willingneſs to forgive others who have done us wrong.</hi> Matth. 6.14, 15. <hi>For, if ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give your treſpaſſes.</hi> Mark 11.25. <hi>And when ye ſtand praying, forgive if ye have ought againſt againſt any; that your Father alſo which is Heaven may forgive you your treſpaſſes.</hi> Having thus in brief explained the Doctrine of <hi>remiſſion of ſins,</hi> it will poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſeem requiſite that I ſhould add a few things more for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler explanation of ſo <hi>great an Article,</hi> which we are all ſo much concerned clearly and diſtinctly to underſtand. In order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, I ſhall further conſider theſe three things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What is meant in Scripture by <hi>Juſtification.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. What is the <hi>procuring cauſe</hi> thereof.</item>
                     <item>3. How any come to be partakers thereof.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the firſt. Juſtification and remiſſion of Sins in the Scripture are one and the ſame thing.<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19.</note> In ſome texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture we are ſaid to be juſtified by Chriſt. In others, that we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>remiſſion of Sins</hi> by Chriſt. In others that we are made righteous by Chriſt. By which expreſſions one and the ſame thing is intended. For Juſtification is a diſcharging us from the guilt of all our ſins, and an acquitting us from the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges of the Law, and a conſtituting us righteous before God, not <hi>qualitative</hi> by making us inherently righteous, with ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs as is Gods Juſtice-proof, (for by ſuch a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs no Son of fallen <hi>Adam</hi> can be juſtified, as we ſhall ſhew after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) but it is a conſtituting us righteous in the ſight of God
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:66289:96"/> or a judicial abſolving of us upon the account of ſatisfaction given and accepted on our behalf: and though Juſtification principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in our pardon, and the remiſſion of our ſins yet; there are other bleſſings alſo ſpringing from it. For thoſe whom God juſtifies, he ſanctifies, &amp; whom he ſanctifies here, he will alſo glorifie hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us conſider the procuring cauſe of our pardon and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. The procuring cauſe of it is the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice by the <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience of Chriſt. And that we may underſtand this the more clearly, let us take into our conſideration theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> required of our <hi>firſt Parents</hi> perfect and ſinleſs obedience upon pain of death. But they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing, fell under the curſe and condemnation of the Law. However, it pleaſed God of his infinite mercy that the Law ſhould not be immediately executed upon them. And yet he did not abrogate it but only relax it as to the right of it by introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing another Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By this ſecond <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> no Son of <hi>fallen Adam</hi> can be juſtified with the <hi>juſtification of an innocent perſon</hi> or as one <hi>perfectly</hi> and <hi>inherently</hi> righteous. For ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (if they ſhould be challenged) are juſtified becauſe they are found without fault or blame, and their juſtification is nothing but a declaration of their righteouſneſs and innocence. But by this <hi>Covenant of</hi> grace we muſt be juſtified as ſinners and offenders, upon a <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> made to the juſtice of God for our ſins. For offenders can no other way be brought into the ſtate of juſt men, but upon a legal pardon and diſcharge. And ſo we may be ſaid to be juſtified when the compenſation or ſatisfaction made for us is accepted, and we thereupon are legally pardoned &amp; diſcharged.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This <hi>Compenſation</hi> or <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made to the juſtice of God in our behalf, is made by the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt, and the whole of our juſtification is founded thereon. I ſay the active as well as the paſſive obedience of Chriſt is here to be reckoned as concurring hereunto. For though Chriſt when he had once aſſumed our nature, and was made Man, was bound to obey the Law; yet in that he voluntarily came from Heaven, and voluntarily took our nature, and ſo voluntarily put himſelf under the obligation of the Law, this conſideration makes his active obedience alſo meritorious. Theſe two are therefore joyntly to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66289:97"/> be conſidered in this matter. For Chriſt <hi>voluntarily</hi> took on him the office of a mediator, He was not compelled to it. Indeed when he was man, he was obliged as a man. A <hi>creatures homage</hi> was due from him when he had aſſumed our nature, but it was his own free choice that brought him into that ſtate and condition. From hence therefore it will follow that all that Chriſt <hi>did</hi> and <hi>ſuffered,</hi> he paid by way of <hi>valuable conſideration</hi> unto God for the ſins of men. The whole fabrick of the Goſpel is bottomed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> made to the <hi>juſtice</hi> of God on our behalf. We are ſaid to be <hi>ranſomed, redeemed, purchaſed, bought with a price,</hi> and that muſt needs be by a <hi>valuable conſideration</hi> paid, and by Satisfaction made. No works of our own could ever amount to ſuch a purchaſe. Could men either have pefectly kept the Law, or have ſufficiently anſwered for the breach of it <hi>ex poſt f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cto, Righteouſneſs</hi> would have been <hi>that way,</hi> and Chriſt had not died.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſts <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience is <hi>reckoned accounted</hi> and <hi>imputed</hi> to thoſe who perform the <hi>conditions</hi> required of them in the Goſpel, for their benefit and advantage, and ſo is made <hi>theirs</hi> as to the benefits redounding therefrom. But it is not <hi>ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them</hi> as if they were righteous in the ſight of God with the ſelf-ſame <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> righteouſneſs wherewith Chriſt was righteous; or as if they had <hi>ſuffered in Chriſt</hi> and <hi>obeyed in Chriſt,</hi> and were as righteous and innocent in Gods eſteem as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Which ſome men dangerouſly preſuming and aſſerting, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from thence that God ſees no ſin in his children but all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which is a wondeful miſtake. For no other perſons righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs can otherwiſe become <hi>ours,</hi> or be imputed to us, than by the effects and advantages of it. It cannot be a <hi>juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to adjudge us to have performed that <hi>our ſelves</hi> which was actually done by <hi>another,</hi> though done <hi>on our behalf</hi> and reckoned <hi>to our benefit.</hi> We are therefore judged righteous for, not in the very righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Some indeed have conceived that Chriſts <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> righteouſneſs are ſo made <hi>ours</hi> by <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> as if we our ſelves were accounted by God to have <hi>done</hi> and <hi>ſuffered</hi> thoſe very things that Chriſt himſelf in his own perſon <hi>did</hi> and <hi>ſuffered.</hi> But how can it be ſuppoſed that God can account us to have done all that which Chriſt did, (that is, to have performed all righteouſneſs without ſin) or to have
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66289:97"/> 
                     <hi>ſuffered all that</hi> which Chriſt ſuffered, which in truth and reality we did not. 'Tis true that God is pleaſed, that the whole of what Chriſt <hi>did</hi> and <hi>ſuffered,</hi> as to the <hi>effects</hi> and <hi>advantages</hi> of it ſhould redound to us, and be for our good and benefit. Thus all that Chriſt did and ſuffered is imputed to us as done <hi>for us,</hi> but not as done <hi>by us.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">See a late learned Treatiſe called <hi>Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical,</hi> by Sr. <hi>C. W.</hi>
                     </note> And thus Chriſt <hi>is the Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi> And what can we deſire more than to reap <hi>all the benefits</hi> of Chriſts <hi>whole undertaking,</hi> and upon the <hi>account</hi> of it, (it being accepted of God in our behalf) to be pardoned and juſtified, ſanctified and ſaved. And thus to have Chriſt made to us of God (as the <hi>fundamental cauſe, procurer</hi> and <hi>ſpring</hi> of them) <hi>wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification</hi> and <hi>redemption.</hi> And thus we ſee that Chriſts perſonal righteouſneſs is not imputable to any creature otherwiſe than as to its operation fruits, and effects. Each juſtified perſons <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> before God is not <hi>identically</hi> and <hi>numerically</hi> the ſame with <hi>Chriſts</hi> in his publick capacity as <hi>Mediator.</hi> For then every juſtified perſon would be <hi>perſonally righteous</hi> with a righteouſneſs that has a ſtock of <hi>merit</hi> in it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſave the world, which is very abſurd to imagine.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſome that alledge againſt what hath here been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, theſe following Scriptures. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>God hath made him to be ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> I anſwer, whereas Chriſt is ſaid to be made <hi>ſin for us,</hi> we are to underſtand it, that he was made a <hi>Sacrifice for our ſins</hi> and that to this end and for this purpoſe, <hi>that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> that is, that we might be made <hi>righteous with a Goſpel righteouſneſs.</hi> He did and ſuffered what was requiſite to make ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God for ſins, that we might reap the fruit of his righteouſneſs, and by believing in him might be accounted for <hi>righteous,</hi> that is, acquitted and pardoned. Not that <hi>his righteouſneſs</hi> is made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally ours, as if we had done and ſuffered what he did and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; but that we might be made the <hi>righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> that is, made <hi>righteous</hi> or acquitted by God through the merit of his righteouſneſs. <hi>[In him]</hi> therefore is not to be taken per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally and literally, but we are ſaid to be <hi>righteous in him,</hi> when we are ſo according to the rule of the Goſpel, and are righteous in the righteouſneſs of Gods appointing and Chriſts procuring. And thus we are ſaid to <hi>walk in him,</hi> when we walk according to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:66289:98"/> the rule of his Goſpel. We are ſaid to <hi>abide in him,</hi> when we continue ſtedfaſt in his doctrine. We are ſaid to <hi>ſleep in him,</hi> when we die in the faith and hope of the Goſpel. We are ſaid to <hi>marry in the Lord,</hi> when we marry according to the rules he has preſcribed. A ſecond Scripture alledged is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one many ſhall be made righteous. I Anſwer,</hi> this text makes nothing for the <hi>transferring</hi> or <hi>imputing</hi> of Chriſts <hi>perſonal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> to us. But it ſhews us theſe things. 1. That as the <hi>effect</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was <hi>univerſal</hi> and <hi>came upon all,</hi> ſo the <hi>effect</hi> of Chriſts obedience was <hi>univerſal;</hi> It came upon all, that is, <hi>all ſorts of men</hi> both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> without diſtinction. 2. <hi>One ſin</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> introduced death, but Chriſts obedience procures forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not only for that <hi>one ſin,</hi> but for all other ſins whatſoever that have inſued thereupon. 3. <hi>One act</hi> of diſobedience was enough to condemn, <hi>but more than one act of obedience</hi> was requiſite to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our pardon. 4. Though Chriſt do not ſave ſo many by his obedience as <hi>Adam</hi> brought into a ſtate of condemnation by his diſobedience, yet the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is much more potent than the firſt: becauſe there is much more efficacy and power required to the ſaving of one than there was to the condemning of many. As the reſtoring of one man to life is much harder than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the lives of many.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As the effect of one mans diſobedience was that thereby many became ſinners, (to be ſhapen in iniquity and brought forth in a ſinful nature;) ſo as the effect and conſequent of one mans obedience many come to be new born and are made righteous. And this ſeems to be the true meaning and import of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Scripture alledged is that of <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Not having mine own righteouſneſs, but the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith Anſwer,</hi> The Apoſtle deſires not to be found in his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as he was a <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Phariſee,</hi> but to be found in Chriſt, ingraffed into him by faith, and to have that righteouſneſs which is of Gods ordaining and Chriſts procuring (and by faith is made ours) which is Goſpel righteouſneſs, and this righteouſneſs we have before deſcribed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I come now to the third thing I propounded to inquire into, namely, <hi>How any come to partake of this great mercy and benefit,</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:66289:98"/> viz. <hi>Juſtification</hi> before God. <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> This is obtained by performing the condition the Goſpel requires, which is <hi>Faith in Chriſt. The Covenant of Grace</hi> is in the propoſal of it <hi>conditional;</hi> and Chriſt with all his <hi>ſaving benefits</hi> is propoſed to us upon terms which we are to perform. Our Saviour ſayes, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ſhall be ſaved, and he that believes not ſhall be damned.</hi> We are ſaid in Scripture to be juſtified by Faith, and the Goſpel is ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Law of Faith;</hi> and whatſoever is required of us by it, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the obedience of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis not a bare aſſent to the truths of the Goſpel or to the Revelation or Hiſtory of Jeſus Chriſt. That <hi>Faith</hi> that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calls a juſtifying Faith is an <hi>operative working Faith,</hi> a Faith that includes in its nature a ſutable acting and obedience. This Faith is never ſpoken of in the Scripture as a bare believing and aſſenting to the truth of the Goſpel in oppoſition to acting agreeably there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, but as the <hi>grand principle</hi> of action, and ſo it is in it ſelf. Since <hi>Abels</hi> time, the ſpring of all religious actions has been <hi>Faith,</hi> viz. <hi>believing God</hi> and <hi>his promiſes</hi> and <hi>threatnings.</hi> The bare believing the truth of Chriſtianity or the bare profeſſing of it, without anſwerable walking and ſutable obedience is not enough to ſave any man. And therefore to be a <hi>true believer</hi> is to be a <hi>ſincere practical Chriſtian.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us that <hi>he that does righteouſneſs is righteous,</hi> and not he that <hi>reckons himſelf ſo</hi> without righteous acting, upon the meer ſcore of his <hi>believing</hi> or bare <hi>profeſſion.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Abraham was not juſtified by Works,</hi> we muſt ſuppoſe him to mean either ſuch perfect ſinleſs works as would in ſtrict rules of juſtice make the reward to be a debt. And ſuch works <hi>Abraham</hi> had not. Or el e <hi>ſuch works</hi> as were depended on by the carnal <hi>Jews,</hi> as ſufficient to procure their pardon and acceptance with God by their own inward work and merit. Theſe he diſclaimes. And when he oppoſeth works to grace, he means ſuch works as were ſuppoſed to juſtifie by their own merit, and which put us out of need of grace. But he knew that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not now ſo attainable but by Faith; yet not by ſuch a Faith as is not accompanied with good works, as St. <hi>James</hi> proves. For <hi>by works</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>Faith is made perfect.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>true ſaving faith compriſes obedience in it,</hi> and is not compleat and perfect without it, nor ſuch a faith as in Scripture is accounted for righteouſneſs. Now <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, the Scripture tells us, was
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:66289:99"/> 
                     <hi>accounted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> But it was ſo accounted with reference to that obedience that was virtually compriſed in it and naturally flowed from it. And that his Faith compriſed in it a ſutable obedience, is manifeſt; elſe it would have been ſo far from being eſteemed or accounted to him for righteouſneſs, that it would rather have been accounted to him for hypocriſie. 'Tis true, <hi>Abraham</hi> could not pretend to a ſinleſs perfection; he had no ſuch works to plead as were <hi>Gods Juſtice-proof.</hi> He had no ſuch righteouſneſs as in its own nature and by its own intrinſick worth could juſtifie him, and denominate him a perfect righteous man. Had it been ſo, it needed not any favour to have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for righteouſn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſs. But God was pleaſed out of his free grace and favour ſo to reckon and account of it. <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith therefore was a <hi>believing the revelation of the Meſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h to come</hi> and of pardon and ſalvation obtainable by him, and <hi>acting ſutably</hi> thereunto by a ſincere though imperfect obedience. This God did impute and account to him for righteouſneſs. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> never intended to exclude <hi>Goſpel works</hi> or ſuch a ſincere obedience as is naturally conſequent to a true and ſaving Faith, and which is accepted of meer grace, and cannot pretend to any merit. But he ſpeaks againſt ſuch works as were depended on, and by vertue of which men pretended to claim juſtification as a reward juſtly due to them, in oppoſition to free grace. Now this <hi>Goſpel juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> we have deſcribed, is ſo far from being ſuch a juſtification by works as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſought after, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſputes againſt, that it is a juſtification that reſults wholly from grace, and is the effect of Chriſts purchaſe and of another covenant; and all merit and reward that can be claimed as a debt is utterly excluded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified upon the terms of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> ſinleſs perfection, but he was juſtified as one that had ſin and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings about him which needed forgiveneſs, and ſo was juſtified by Faith in the Goſpel-way; but it was by an operative faith which was productive of good works. Which works were not ſuch as by any innate virtue in themſelves did conſtitute him juſt, but were the fruits and genuine off-ſpring of his faith which reſted on the promiſed Meſſiah, as the ſole procurer of his pardon and forgiveneſs. Sinleſs works therefore we ſee were neceſſary under the Covenant of Works to obtain the reward as a juſt debt; but ſincere works are neceſſary under the Covenant of Grace as the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:66289:99"/> genuine fruits of faith without which it is imperfect. For if it be without works 'tis no true juſtifying Faith, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> abundantly proves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt take heed we do not ſo apprehend of Faith, as if it had in it ſelf any juſtifying virtue or were of any innate worth to acquit us before God from the guilt of our ſins. The value of it is wholly from Gods ordination and its relation to Chriſt. We are juſtified by Chriſt alone meritoriouſly and by what he has done and ſuffered. Faith is but a conditional means by which we come to reap the fruit and benefit of Chriſts merits.</p>
                  <p>Faith therefore and believing being the Goſpel condition, let us further inquire what is comprehended in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, The way and method of Gods juſtifying a ſinner being founded on the depth of his own infinite wiſdom, and no way ſuited to the corrupt reaſonings of a carnal mind, God expects we ſhould fully believe it and firmly aſſent to the truth of it. And this in it ſelf is a righteous act (and ſo accounted of God) firmly to believe him and what he reveals to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He expects we ſhould thankfully accept and acquieſce in, and rely upon this way of Juſtification, which he tenders to us, without quarrelling or diſputing; and that we ſhould receive Chriſt in all his offices as our <hi>Prophet, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That we ſhould ſubject our ſelves to all the Precepts of the Goſpel, and that our faith ſhould approve it ſelf to be of the right kind by a ſutable obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> But does not the annexing of ſuch a condition as this unto forgiveneſs leſſen the grace and bounty of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> No, in no wiſe. For conſider theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The diſpenſing of pardon and forgiveneſs upon ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as faith in Chriſt, which includes Goſpel obedience, is one of the moſt effectual means to introduce ſanctity and holineſs into the World. For what more effectual way can there be to do it, than to make it conditionally neceſſary to juſtification and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Gods immutable holineſs and juſtice is hereby made more illuſtrious, and his ſolemn hatred and diſlike of ſin is more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted. For hereby 'tis evident that God will ſave no man in his ſins, but from his ſins. Whom he juſtifies he will ſanctify. No mans ſin is ſo forgiven, that the leaſt allowance is vouchſafed to it. None but ſuch as are ſanctified can be accepted of him.</p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:66289:100"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Whatever is by the Goſpel conditionally required of us, is fully and freely given us. Faith and every other grace is the gift of God. We perform the condition required of us ſolely by the power of his grace freely given unto us. And all the rewards of the Goſpel are but the gracious remunerations of Gods own gifts and graces. Free grace and divine bounty is the root that bears all. And therefore the holieſt men on earth have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cauſe to be moſt humble. For having received moſt, they ought moſt to abaſe themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. 'Tis fit that all who ſhall be ſaved ſhould be rationally ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the excellency of that life the Goſpel calls them unto. For the precepts of the Goſpel are framed and calculated for our advantage and benefit. The commands of Chriſt are in no wiſe grievous to any man truly and rationally informed of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. The Goſpel commands us to be ſober, righteous, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and 'tis rationally beſt for us ſo to be, both in order to our own good, and the good and benefit of others among whom we live. And therefore 'tis fit we ſhould make a ſolemn choice of this life for our ſelves, and ſeriouſly reſolve as men of truth and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to purſue it. There ought to be ſincerity of intention and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in us to live this life, though we do not arrive at perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of action. We ſhould therefore examine what is the <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate choice</hi> of our wills, whether to be <hi>Sanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt</hi> as well as to be <hi>juſtified by his merits.</hi> Chriſt will not judge of us by a ſuddain paſſionate choice, but by our rational and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed choice. And we muſt eſpecially take heed of all degrees of inſincerity and hypocriſie, which of all ſins under the Goſpel does moſt dangerouſly border on a breach of the condition required. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, thoſe things that keep people uſually from the good things of the Goſpel are either <hi>a direct refuſal of Chriſt,</hi> or a <hi>ſloathful careleſneſs, unconcerned neglect of him,</hi> or a <hi>prevailing falſeneſs in the courſe of Goſpel obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude all that I ſhall ſay upon this argument with theſe four particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our Lord and Saviour did certainly perform all things that were required to be performed by him <hi>as our mediator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By reaſon of the high dignity of his perſon, his obedience and ſufferings are of more value and worth than the obedience and ſufferings of all mankind would have been.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:66289:100"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe things being performed by him in our nature and wholly upon o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r account, God accepts them for us, though not as done by us, and reckons all the benefits and advantages of them to us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If we deſire to partake of the benefits of Chriſts <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience, we muſt ſincerly believe in him and take him for our Lord and Saviour; and if our <hi>Faith</hi> be a true juſtifying <hi>Faith,</hi> it will <hi>purify our hearts and reform our lives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus explained this Doctrine of the <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> of ſins, let us now conſider what improvement we ſhould make of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us admire the infinite goodneſs of God, that there is a poſſibility of pardon for the children of men, who are naturally under wrath. There is <hi>none</hi> for the Angels that fell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us often meditate upon, and admire <hi>the way</hi> of it. 1. No pardon to be obtained for man without a <hi>Mediator.</hi> And where could <hi>fallen man</hi> have found a <hi>Mediator,</hi> that would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken his cauſe? 2. No <hi>ordinary Mediator</hi> would ſuffice. If all the holy Angels had joyned together, it would have not been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Only the <hi>eternal Son</hi> of God could effect it. 3. Let us conſider, that Chriſt obtained our peace not by a <hi>bare mediation,</hi> but by <hi>paying a price</hi> for us, and making full ſatisfaction to the Will and Juſtice of God by his obedience and ſufferings.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us often admire the benefits of it. 1. It is not only a great mercy in it ſelf, but the foundation of all other mercies. 'Tis the <hi>Queen of mercies,</hi> that hath a glorious train of other mercies attending it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſins are forgiven, whoſe iniquities are covered, to whom the Lord imputeth not tranſgreſſion.</hi> None of the antient Philoſophers ever gave ſuch a <hi>definition of happineſs.</hi> 2. The ſenſe of this mercy makes all <hi>afflictions</hi> more eaſie to be born. What can hurt us if God be reconciled to us? 3. <hi>Pardoning mercy</hi> brings <hi>healing</hi> with it unto the Soul. Chriſt <hi>Sanctifies</hi> thoſe by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> whoſe pardon he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures by his <hi>Merits.</hi> 4. It affords great comfort againſt death, which is otherwiſe <hi>terrible of terribles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. If pardoning mercy be ſo great a mercy, let us often conſider how vile and wretched thoſe perſons are who ſlight this mercy. But who are they? 1. All <hi>careleſs</hi> ones who <hi>neglect this great ſalvation,</hi> and prefer the things of the World before it.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66289:101"/> 2. All <hi>wicked and prophane</hi> ones, who go on daily increaſing their guilt, not minding to make peace with God. 3. All that reſt on any thing beſides Chriſts righteouſneſs and interceſſion, for the procuring their pardon with God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let us all examine our ſelves whether we have obtained this bleſſedneſs or no. Many content themſelves with <hi>weak grounds,</hi> on which they build their hopes of pardon. 1. They are not ſo bad as others. They think they are ſinners; yet guilty but of few ſins in compariſon of what others are guilty of. I anſwer, Poſſibly they may not be ſo bad as others, yet they may be in a very bad condition for all that; out of which, if they do not get, they will be everlaſtingly miſerable. 2. Others think well of them. Be it ſo. But we ſhall not ſtand or fall by mans Judgment. 3. They live civilly, ſo they may do, and yet be unconverted; and without true converſion and regeneration, no ſalvation is to be expected.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Seeing God is ready to forgive, let us all endeavor to ſecure this bleſſedneſs to our ſelves. 1. Let us ſeek it as earneſtly as ever we ſought any thing in the World. 2. thoſe that muſt ſhortly be arraigned. If a guilty Malefactor knew that the <hi>Aſſizes</hi> drew nigh, at which he could not expect but to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, ſurely above all things in the world he would endeavor to get his pardon. 3. Let us ſeek it as thoſe who are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be put off with any thing elſe beſides it. And to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us hereunto, let us conſider. 1. God is ready to pardon. He hath ſworn that <hi>he delights not in the death of a ſinner.</hi> 2. Chriſt died for this very purpoſe to redeem us, and when he was on the earth, he complained that people would not come to him, and believe in him, that <hi>by him they might have life.</hi> 3. All means of grace afforded to us are <hi>intimations</hi> that God intends us mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if we be not wanting to our ſelves. 4. All good motions and ſtirrings of the Spirit of God in our hearts are ſignifications of his good will towards us. 5. And laſtly, As <hi>vile</hi> or <hi>viler</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners then we are have obtained pardon, and why then ſhould not we encourage our ſelves to ſeek after pardon while it may be obtained.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. A <hi>Metaphorical Reſurrection, viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Soul</hi> out of the ſtate of Sin and Spiritual Death.

                  </p>
                  <p>Let us now conſider what improvement we ſhould make of this doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us take heed of <hi>erring</hi> about this doctrine. Let us take heed of the <hi>leven of the Sadducees,</hi> who ſaid there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection <hi>Acts</hi> 23.8. There are <hi>two ſorts</hi> of perſons that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly erre about this doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe that affirm that there is <hi>no other Reſurrection</hi> but that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66289:103"/> which is <hi>Spiritual, viz.</hi> that of the ſoul from the death of ſin. This was the error of <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.17, 18. They acknowledged no other Reſurrection but the <hi>renovation of the mind</hi> which paſſes upon a man in this life. Now this <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Reſurrection</hi> is limited only to <hi>true Believers;</hi> but the <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> belongs to <hi>all that are in the Graves,</hi> of whom our Saviour ſays, <hi>John</hi> 5.29. <hi>They ſhall all come forth,</hi> ſome to <hi>life</hi> and ſome to <hi>damnation,</hi> which cannot poſſibly be meant of the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Reſurrection, and therefore there is <hi>another</hi> beſides that.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe that ſay the <hi>ſame numerical body</hi> that died ſhall not riſe again; but ſome <hi>new airy body,</hi> not fleſh and blood, bones and ſinews as ours are made up of. But this is a great error. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the <hi>ſame bodies</hi> do not ariſe, then 'tis not a <hi>Reſurrection</hi> but a <hi>new Creation.</hi> I acknowledge 'tis not neceſſary they ſhould ariſe with <hi>every parcel</hi> and <hi>particle</hi> of fleſh they ever had, or had when they dyed; but they ſhall riſe with <hi>ſo much</hi> of their bodies as ſhall make them the <hi>ſame numerical bodies</hi> that died. As a man in the Wars if he loſe an <hi>arm</hi> or a <hi>leg,</hi> yet we ſay (and ſay truly) he is the <hi>ſame man</hi> ſtill that he was before. So the dead ſhall riſe with ſo much of their bodies, as ſhall (when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united to their ſouls) make them the <hi>ſame perſons</hi> they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Saviour ſayes <hi>all that are in the Graves ſhall come forth,</hi> that is, ſurely <hi>the ſame bodies</hi> that lay there, and not <hi>other bodies</hi> for them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.13. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>the Sea ſhall render up its dead;</hi> ſurely not <hi>new bodies</hi> but the <hi>old bodies</hi> that were buried there.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Bodies</hi> of true Believers as well as their <hi>Souls</hi> are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt, and thereby made <hi>the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle aſſures us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. And can you think Chriſt will loſe any one of his members? he aſſures us to the contrary, <hi>John</hi> 6.39, <hi>r</hi> 40.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>this corruptible, this mortal</hi> ſhall put on <hi>incorruption</hi> and <hi>immortality,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53. Therefore the <hi>ſame bodies</hi> that are <hi>now mortal</hi> and muſt die, ſhall be raiſed. And indeed the Apoſtle plainly ſhews all along in that excellent diſcourſe of the Reſurrection, that he intends that the <hi>ſame body</hi> that dyed ſhould riſe again.</p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:66289:103"/>
                  <p n="5">5. It ſeems moſt agreeable to the Juſtice of God, that it ſhould be ſo; <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>ſame numerical body</hi> that was the ſouls <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi> either in <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> actions, either in works of <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>Sin,</hi> ſhould partake with the Soul alſo in its <hi>rewards</hi> or <hi>puniſhments,</hi> ſhall they that <hi>beat down their bodies</hi> and bring them into ſubjection, or <hi>ſuffer Martyrdom</hi> in their bodies for the cauſe of Chriſt be rewarded in <hi>other bodies</hi> than thoſe that thus ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Or ſhall <hi>that body</hi> and <hi>fleſh</hi> of a wicked man, which was ſo great an inſtrument of his ſoul in ſinning againſt God, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of him, and hurting others, be diſſolved into duſt, and ſhall <hi>another body</hi> be framed for that <hi>miſerable ſoul,</hi> to ſuffer with it thoſe exquiſite torments that the damned muſt ſuffer for ever? Surely this cannot be. Therefore it ſeems moſt agreeable to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of God, that every one ſhould receive either <hi>reward</hi> or <hi>puniſhment</hi> in his own body, which he had here in this life.</p>

                     <hi>for the dead,</hi> namely for profeſſing to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> the Reſurrection of the dead. <hi>And why ſtand we in jeopardy every hour, viz.</hi> of the <hi>like Baptiſm</hi> for the ſame profeſſion, either from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cuting <hi>Sadducees,</hi> who allow no Reſurrection, or from the <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Jews,</hi> who deny Chriſt to be riſen? (2.) This Article is a great foundation of a Chriſtians hope, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead. For if in this life only we had hope, we were of all men moſt miſerable,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. (3.) This Doctrine tends much to the illuſtrating the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:66289:104"/> infinite wiſdom, power, juſtice and mercy of God. (4.) It teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us how much we owe to our Lord and Saviour who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed our <hi>bodies</hi> as well as our <hi>ſouls,</hi> and will ſave our bodies as well as our ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If there will be a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> let us not bewail the death of our pious friends with too much ſorrow or concernment. Their bodies are but laid up for a glorious Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The conſideration and belief of the Reſurrection ſhould ſtrengthen us againſt the fear of our <hi>own death.</hi> As God ſaid to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 46.3, 4. <hi>Fear not to go down into</hi> Egypt; <hi>for I will go with thee, and bring thee up again.</hi> So a <hi>dying Saint</hi> may ſay to his body, <hi>fear not to go down into the grave,</hi> into the <hi>dark and diſmal vault,</hi> my dear Redeemer will bring thee up again. Death to the Righteous is but like the pulling down of an old ruinous houſe to build it again in a more excellent and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If God <hi>can</hi> and <hi>will</hi> raiſe <hi>the dead,</hi> it ſhould ſtrengthen our Faith in Gods power that he can raiſe us up <hi>out of any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> into which we are at any time fallen, and that he can raiſe up his <hi>own intereſt</hi> in the World, or in any Nation, though it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo low. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17, 21. What cannot that God do, who quickneth the dead?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It ſhould teach us not to ſet too high a price or value upon our <hi>own lives</hi> when we are called to expoſe them for the cauſe of Chriſt or for our Countreys good. Every faithful ſervant of Chriſt that ſo loſes his bodily life, takes the beſt courſe to have it reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him with advantage. And in this ſenſe our Saviour ſayes, <hi>he that loſeth his life ſhall ſave it,</hi> that is, ſhall not only recover it again at the Reſurrection, but ſhall over and above alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with eternal life in glory, <hi>John</hi> 12.25. <hi>He that loveth his life ſhall loſe it, and he that hateth his life in this World ſhall keep it unto life eternal.</hi> If God therefore call thee to expoſe thy body to death for him, fear not to do it: He will raiſe it up again in a more glorious manner. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>thoſe Worthies, Heb.</hi> 11.35. that were <hi>wracked and tormented</hi> for profeſſing the truth, that they <hi>refuſed</hi> to be delivered (<hi>viz.</hi> to the prejudice of their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) expecting a <hi>better Reſurrection</hi> than that now offered them, <hi>viz.</hi> to be delivered or raiſed up from their preſent pains and ſufferings.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:66289:104"/> They expected a Reſurrection of their bodies to eternal glory.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This ſhould deterr us from <hi>ſinning with our bodies,</hi> which muſt be raiſed again, and if we die in our ſins, muſt ſuffer with our ſouls everlaſting puniſhment. Let us take heed of imploying our bodies as <hi>inſtruments</hi> of ſin. Remember (O ſinner) <hi>that wretched body</hi> of thine which thou haſt ſo often debauched by drunkenneſs, and polluted and defiled by uncleanneſs, it muſt riſe again to damnation except thou repent; that <hi>tongue</hi> of thine with which thou haſt ſo often <hi>lyed, cheated, ſcoffed at ſerious piety,</hi> and diſhonoured God by <hi>ſwearing, curſing, ribbaldry, backbiting, &amp;c.</hi> ſhall be tormented in that ſame flame that <hi>Dives</hi> was tormented in. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. As Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Judas,</hi> it <hi>had been better for him he had never been born;</hi> ſo we may ſay of ſome men, <hi>It were better for them they might not riſe again.</hi> But as the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, ſo they muſt ſuffer together. And as they inticed one another to ſin, ſo they muſt be together for ever miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And laſtly. Let us labour to be united unto Chriſt by a lively faith, that he may raiſe us up <hi>as our Head.</hi> He will raiſe the wicked <hi>as their Judge.</hi> He is Lord <hi>both of dead and living,</hi> and ſo hath <hi>right</hi> by that dominion to <hi>raiſe the dead, Rom.</hi> 14.9. and will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly do it. And ſome he will raiſe to ſuffer everlaſting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and others to a glorious everlaſting life. And of ſuch as theſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> 11.25. <hi>Whoſo believeth on him ſhall never die,</hi> that is, <hi>eternally,</hi> ſo as to ſuffer everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>It now only remains that I ſhould anſwer three queſtions, and then I ſhall ſhut up this diſcourſe. 1.

That we ſhall all of us be raiſed in that proportion of ſtrength which men attain to <hi>commonly,</hi> at their beſt <hi>eſtate.</hi> And this reſolution of the caſe the Apoſtle doth ſeem to favour, when he ſaith, that though <hi>the body be ſown in weakneſs,</hi> (in the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66289:105"/> of old age or infancy) yet <hi>it ſhall be raiſed in power.</hi> All imperfections and deformities ſhall be taken away.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:66289:105"/> out of <hi>this world</hi> into the other, without death intervening. <hi>Enoch,</hi> who lived before the giving of the Law, and <hi>Elijah</hi> who lived after, are both inſtances of this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Enoch walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God, and he was not: for God took him,</hi> Heb. 11.5. <hi>By Faith Enoch was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death, and was not found, becauſe God had tranſlated him,</hi> And ſo <hi>Elijah</hi> was carried up in a fiery Chariot, and by a whirlwind into Heaven, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.11.

                  <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>life eternal Initial,</hi> which is the <hi>life of grace,</hi> John 3.36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life,</hi> that is, hath it <hi>begun in him,</hi> hath the <hi>earneſt of it</hi> in his Soul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Partial life eternal,</hi> which is the <hi>life</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the <hi>Soul</hi> when it is ſeparated from the body; 'Tis the happineſs which the ſouls of the Righteous enjoy between the time of death and the day of Judgment. The Scripture is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in aſſerting this kind of <hi>life eternal,</hi> which the ſeparated ſoul injoys in the other world, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt return to the earth as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return unto God who gave it,</hi> Matth 10.28. <hi>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the Soul, but rather fear him which is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both ſoul and body in Hell,</hi> Luke 12.4. <hi>Be not afraid of them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom you ſhall fear. Fear him who after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into Hell, yea I ſay fear him,</hi> Heb. 12.23. <hi>To the general aſſembly and Church of the firſt-born, which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt men, made perfect, Luke</hi> 23.43. Our Saviour ſaid to the penitent Thief, <hi>To day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> Luke 23.46. <hi>And when Jeſus had cried with a loud voice, he ſaid, Father into thy hands I commit my Spirit; and having ſaid thus, he gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> Acts 7.59. <hi>And they ſtoned</hi> Stephen, <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon God, and ſaying, Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit,</hi> Phil. 1.23. <hi>For I am in a ſtrait betwixt two, having a deſire to depart, and to he with Chriſt, which is far better,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.19. <hi>By which alſo he went and preached to the Spirits (now) in Priſon,</hi> Rev. 6.9, 10. <hi>And when he had opened the fifth Seal, I ſaw under the Altar the Souls of them that were ſlain for the word of God, and for the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony which they held. And they cried with a loud voice ſaying, How long O Lord holy and true doſt thou not judge and revenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is <hi>a life eternal Perfectional,</hi> which ſhall be conferred on the Saints after the <hi>re-union</hi> of their Souls and Bodies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34, 46. <hi>Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand, come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the World. Then ſhall the Righteous go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life eternal.</hi> Now this <hi>perfectional life everlaſting</hi> (which will
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:66289:106"/> be the portion of the Saints at the laſt day) is ſuch a <hi>life</hi> as ſhall be free from all evil, and full of all good.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Free from <hi>the evil of ſin.</hi> The Souls of the Juſt ſhall then be made perfect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>evil of temptation.</hi> There was a <hi>Tempter</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> there will be none in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>evil of affliction.</hi> All tears ſhall be wiped from your eyes. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This life ſhall be <hi>full of all good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Their <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings</hi> ſhall have a clear knowledge, ſight and viſion of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their <hi>Wills</hi> ſhall be perfected and adorned with an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and indefective holineſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their <hi>Affections</hi> ſhall be ſet right with an unalterable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They ſhall injoy an <hi>uninterrupted</hi> communion with God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They ſhall be bleſſed in their company.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And laſtly, They ſhall have this bleſſedneſs ſecured to them without fear of ever loſing it or being deprived of it; But though the Saints ſhall enjoy ſuch an <hi>eternal life in bliſs,</hi> as we have before deſcribed, yet it ſhall not be ſo with the wicked. Eternal life in miſery will be their portion. They ſhall be tormented, 1. <hi>With the pain of loſs,</hi> 2. With the pain of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> 3. With the worm of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> a tormenting reflection on their former folly. 4. With deſpair of ever coming out of that woful miſery which is the very Hell of Hell. But of theſe things I have ſpoken more largely in the former Treatiſe pag. 130.</p>
                  <p>It remaines therefore now that I ſhew what improvement we are to make of this Article, and then I ſhall ſhut up this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We may from hence learn, how inexcuſable they are who hazard and expoſe their ſouls and bodies to eternal torments for a ſhort ſatisfaction of their bruitiſh luſts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſhould conſider that there is no <hi>concern</hi> we have in the World, that ſhould lie <hi>ſo near</hi> our hearts as the making our peace with God upon ſure and ſafe grounds.</p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:66289:107"/>
                  <p n="3">3. From hence we may learn how highly we ought to prize the <hi>blood</hi> of Chriſt and <hi>his undertaking,</hi> by which alone we can <hi>eſcape the wrath that is to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It may ſhew us how we ought to pity thoſe who are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on in a full carreer to Hell. How ſhould we endeavour by our earneſt intreaties to keep them from falling into that diſmal place of torment?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſhould conſider with what extreme folly they are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, who mind only this preſent life; that live as if there were no other life beſides this, or none elſe worth looking after.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſhould above all things endeavour to ſecure to our ſelves <hi>eternal life</hi> in <hi>Bliſs</hi> and <hi>Happineſs.</hi> Every man and womans portion muſt be <hi>one</hi> of theſe two, either <hi>everlaſting life in Bliſs,</hi> or <hi>everlaſting damnation.</hi> And if we muſt be either eternally <hi>happy</hi> or eternally <hi>miſerable,</hi> methinks it ſhould make us paſs the time of our ſojourning here in fear, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. and to <hi>give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make our calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. And to quicken our diligence hereunto, leet us conſider theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By nature we have no <hi>title</hi> to everlaſting Bliſs. By nature we are children of Wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt be united to Chriſt, if ever we intend to obtain it. God hath given eternal life, <hi>and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life, he that hath not the Son hath not life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Holineſs of heart and life here is neceſſary for the obtaining of eternal life in bliſs and happineſs hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As Parents have been inſtrumental (under God) of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying a temporal life to their Children. So they ſhould labour (as much as poſſibly they can) that they may be ſo religiouſly inſtructed and educated, that they may at laſt obtain an eternal life in bliſs and happineſs.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Flaminis ſive Spiritus.</hi> The Baptiſm of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. 3.11. <hi>I baptize you with water</hi> (ſaies <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt) <hi>but he that cometh after me ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Sanguinis ſive Martyrii.</hi> The Baptiſm of <hi>Sufferings,</hi> Mat. 20.22. <hi>Are ye able</hi> (ſayes our Saviour to the ſons of <hi>Zebedee) to drink of the Cup that I ſhall drink of, and to be Baptized with the Baptiſm that I am to be Baptized with,</hi> that is, are ye able to partake with me in thoſe ſufferings and afflictions which I am ſhortly to undergo.</p>
                  <p>I am to ſpeak of the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Baptiſm of water</hi> Concerning which, that I may proceed Methodically, I ſhall ſpeak.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Of the Inſtitution of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Of the Nature of it.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>I ſhall inquire who are the perſons that ought to be Baptized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Whether Baptiſm be of abſolute neceſſity to Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>What improvement thoſe who were baptized in their infancy ought to make of their Baptiſm, when they are grown up and come to years of underſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>What are the particular duties of Chriſtian Parents towards their infant Seed and Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I begin with the firſt. <hi>The inſtitution.</hi> 'Tis God only who hath authority to appoint Sacraments in the Church. 'Tis his <hi>divine inſtitution</hi> which makes a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> The whole Church cannot do it, And <hi>John</hi> 1.33. We read that <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion <hi>to Baptize with water. He that ſent me to Baptize with water, the ſame ſaid unto me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt gave Commiſſion to his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the firſt year of his publick Miniſtry to baptize, elſe 'tis not imaginable they would have done it, <hi>John</hi> 3.22. <hi>After theſe things came Jeſus and his Diſciples into the land of Judea, and there he tarried with them and baptized</hi> (that is by the hands of his Apoſtles) for <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus himſelf baptized not, but his Diſciples,</hi> John 4.12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After his Reſurrection he enlarged the Commiſſion, of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Here he preſcribes the form they ſhould uſe in the adminiſtration of Baptiſm, injoyning them to baptize <hi>in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And the words in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believes and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> ſeem to be an addition to thoſe in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. and are not any expreſs direction as to the <hi>admitting Infants,</hi> or <hi>not admitting them,</hi> but a direction how they ſhould go and <hi>diſciple</hi> the Heathen Nations by preaching the Goſpel to them, and when they had converted any to Chriſtianity, they ſhould baptize them, and ſo bring them into <hi>Covenant</hi> with God; and when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were in Covenant, their Children could not fail to be ſo alſo, as (God willing) we ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We come to conſider the <hi>Nature of Baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in its general notion, is an outward viſible ſign and repreſentation of inward and ſpiritual bleſſings and benefits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed and made over by Chriſt unto the perſons baptized, they performing the conditions required of them.</p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:66289:108"/>
                  <p>In Baptiſm there are two parts
<list>
                        <item>1. The <hi>Outward.</hi>
                        </item>

                  <p>In the <hi>outward part</hi> there are three things conſiderable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The outward Element, <hi>Water,</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. The form of adminiſtring or applying the water, <hi>viz. in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The quantity of water which is to be uſed, is not limited by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures. <hi>Sprinkling</hi>

                     </note> is as ſignificant <hi>(as to the main ends of Baptiſm)</hi> as <hi>dipping.</hi> Therefore the blood of Chriſt (which is ſignified by Baptiſm) is called <hi>the blood of Sprinkling,</hi> Heb. 12.24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. And <hi>ſprinkling</hi> comes nearer the <hi>baptiſm</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the old Teſtament, than <hi>dipping</hi> doth. For the Children of <hi>Iſraels paſſing under the Cloud and through the red-Sea,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. is called a <hi>baptizing.</hi> And ſurely they were not dipped in the Cloud, but only <hi>ſprinkled</hi> with it, that is, with ſome drops that fell from it; nor <hi>dipped</hi> in the red-Sea (as the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> were, who were drowed therein) but only touched it with their feet, or elſe poſſibly ſome drops from the waves of it might be blown upon them by the wind. But againſt this ſome object that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Buried with him in Baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Our Baptiſm ſhews our communion with Chriſt in his death, it being a ſign and repreſentation of Chriſts <hi>blood ſhed,</hi> and conſequently of his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>burial;</hi> and ſhould mind us that in conformity to him we ſhould die unto ſin. But we muſt not preſs Metaphors too far, elſe as Chriſt lay <hi>three dayes</hi> and <hi>three nights</hi> in the Grave, ſo we muſt lie under water, which if it were practiſed would quickly end this controverſie. Beſides, our <hi>pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring water</hi> on the perſon baptized reſembling in a ſort the <hi>pouring duſt</hi> or <hi>earth</hi> on a dead body, may be a repreſentation of <hi>Burial</hi> alſo. But we muſt not (as I ſaid) ſtrain reſemblances too far. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we do not find that our Saviour and the Apoſtles continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every circumſtance that was in uſe in the <hi>firſt inſtitution</hi> of the Sacrament of the <hi>Paſsover.</hi> As particularly, they were at firſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:66289:109" rendition="simple:additions"/> injoyned to ſprinkle their door-poſts with the blood of the lamb, and to eat it with their loins girt, and ſtaves in their hands, as people in haſte, ready to march out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But this and other circumſtances we do not find obſerved by our Saviour or his Apoſtles in their eating the <hi>Paſsover.</hi> Therefore ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may be varied according to <hi>Chriſtian prudence,</hi> provided we keep cloſe to <hi>the main</hi> of the inſtitution, and the ends of it. To conclude this particular, <hi>baptizing</hi> is any kind of <hi>religious waſhing,</hi> or <hi>ſprinkling in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> duly performed by a perſon rightly qualified for it. And what Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſayes in this matter is conſiderable, <hi>viz.</hi> that if we were to baptize a converted Pagan or Turk of ripe years, in a hot Countrey (mark that) we might baptize him by <hi>dipping.</hi> And ſo much of the outward part. The <hi>inward part</hi> of Baptiſm or the <hi>ſpiritual myſteries</hi> hereby ſignified are theſe two.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>blood of Chriſt</hi> ſprinkled upon the Soul for the waſhing away the guilt of ſin, and procuring remiſſion and juſtification to the perſon baptized.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>grace of Chriſt</hi> poured into the Soul, purging out the power and dominion of ſin by regeneration and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We come now to conſider <hi>the excellent ends and uſes of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Baptiſm, as it has reference to God is a ſign or ſolemn <hi>rite</hi> ſignifying the waſhing away of the guilt of our ſins in Chriſts blood, and the Sanctifying our natures by his holy Spirit. And is a <hi>Seal</hi> to confirm it to us, as <hi>circumciſion</hi> was to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Rom. 4.11. Into whoſe place it ſucceeds, as we ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Baptiſm, <hi>as it has reference to us,</hi> is a ſolemn dedicating and and conſecrating us to the ſincere worſhip and ſervice of God the <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 1. 'Tis a dedicating and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us to <hi>God the Father</hi> as our <hi>Creator,</hi> that we ſhould obey him as our <hi>rightful Lord,</hi> love him and depend on him as the <hi>fountain</hi> of our happineſs, preferring his favour before any thing elſe in the world. 2. 'Tis a dedicating us to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that we ſhould <hi>believe in him,</hi> and accept him as our Saviour and Redeemer, expecting to be ſaved only by his merits, righteouſneſs and interceſſion. 3. 'Tis a dedicating us to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that we ſhould accept him as our guide, ſanctifier, and comforter, that by him we
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:66289:109" rendition="simple:additions"/> may be freed from the dominion of ſin, have the image of God repaired in us, be led into all ſaving truths, and guided in the wayes of godlineſs, and comforted with a ſence of Gods love in Chriſt, and hope of eternal glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis a ſolemn ingaging us to <hi>renounce the Devil, the World and the Fleſh</hi> as the <hi>three great enemies</hi> of God and our Souls. They are all expreſſed in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 28. and 3. <hi>in times paſt ye walked according to the courſe of this World, according to the Prince of the power of the air, the Spirit that now worketh in the Children of diſobedience. Among whom we alſo had our converſation in times paſt, in the luſts of our fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. 'Tis an enrolling us into Chriſts family <hi>the viſible Church,</hi> to walk in union and holy communion with the members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>By one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. 'Tis an obligation or bond of obedience engaging us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the <hi>precepts</hi> of the Goſpel. We are thereby engaged to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> of our ſins, to <hi>believe in Chriſt,</hi> to endeavour to be holy in all manner of converſation, and to take up our croſs when our Saviour calls us to it. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the Galathians, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>I teſtify to every one that is circumciſed, that he is debtor to the whole Law.</hi> So ſay I to every one that is <hi>baptized,</hi> he is a debtor to the whole Goſpel, and bound to obſerve the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of it. And ſo much of the excellent ends and uſes of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the fourth particular, to conſider <hi>who are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ought to be baptized?</hi> Thoſe are to be Baptized who are converted to the Faith of Chriſt, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>one</hi> or <hi>both</hi> Chriſtian Parents. The <hi>former part</hi> of this po- is granted by all. But there are ſome who doubt of the <hi>latter.</hi> ſition That I may therefore more clearly prove the <hi>right of infants of Chriſtian Parents</hi> to baptiſm, I ſhall firſt lay down ſome <hi>rules,</hi> which it will be requiſite for us to obſerve in this matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are many <hi>great truths</hi> couched and comprehended in the Scriptures which are not <hi>plainly</hi> and in ſo many words expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and whatſoever may be rightly deduced by neceſſary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable conſequence from Scripture is <hi>Scripture,</hi> and binding
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:66289:110"/> to us. Our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31. proved the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the dead againſt the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> not by expreſs Scripture but by conſequence and deduction from Scripture. See Sect. 6. <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning life everlaſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe truths which are more plainly revealed in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> are more ſparingly mentioned in the <hi>New,</hi> and thoſe that are more darkly mentioned in the <hi>Old,</hi> are more clearly revealed in the <hi>New.</hi> There is much ſaid of the priviledges of <hi>children</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and particularly of their <hi>right</hi> to the Seal of the Covenant, and therefore the leſs is ſpoken of it in the <hi>New.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe truths which were not controverted in the Apoſtles dayes, they were not ſo zealous in preſſing, or defending, there being not any apparent reaſon or occaſion for it. And of that nature <hi>the Baptiſm of Infants</hi> ſeems to be.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thoſe Scriptures which ſpeak of the priviledges of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> or <hi>Infants,</hi> are the fitteſt Judges of this controverſie, and not thoſe which ſpeak only of the priviledges of <hi>grown or adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> As if the queſtion be, <hi>whether any Infants may be ſaved?</hi> you muſt not determine it by <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> (For this concerns only grown perſons) but by ſuch ſcriptures as theſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 7. and <hi>v.</hi> 10.11, 12. Where God promiſes to be <hi>a God to Abraham, and to his Seed,</hi> and requires that his male children at <hi>eight dayes old</hi> ſhould be circumciſed as a token or ſeal of the Covenant between him and them. So if there ſhould be a queſtion ſtarted, <hi>whether Parents ought to maintain their Children in their Infancy?</hi> you muſt not determine this queſtion by 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. Where the Apoſtles ſayes, <hi>this we commanded you, that if any will not work, neither ſhould he eat,</hi> but by 1 Tim. 5.8. <hi>He that provides not for his family is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> And according to this rule we muſt proceed in this matter. This controverſie muſt be determined by thoſe places of Scripture which do either <hi>expreſs</hi> or <hi>imply</hi> the priviledges of Infants. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid down theſe rules, I come now to give ſome arguments or reaſons for <hi>Infant Baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> ſtands now in force for the benefit of the Children of believing Parents, and if they be within the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:66289:110"/> Covenant of God, <hi>the Seal</hi>

                     <hi>of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> belongs to them. <hi>Be baptized every one of you</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Jews,</hi> Acts 2.39.) <hi>For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to you and to your Children.</hi> The ſame Greek word that is here uſed for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is uſed for Infants and Children at nurſe, as may appear, if you conſult 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. If it were not ſo, the <hi>converted Jews</hi> ſhould have ſuffered <hi>loſs,</hi> by believing in Chriſt, namely, if their children ſhould be excluded now from the promiſe or Covenant of grace, who were included in it for 2000 years before, under the old Adminiſtration. For, as we ſaid before, God <hi>eſtabliſhed a Covenant with Abraham and his ſeed.</hi> And <hi>Iſaac</hi> was within this Covenant when he was but <hi>eight dayes old,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Seal of it. Now concerning <hi>this Covenant</hi> made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> obſerve theſe particulars. 1. It was <hi>an evangelical Covenant,</hi> and the Seal of it, <hi>viz. Circumciſion</hi> was <hi>the Seal of the righteouſneſs which is by Faith, Rom.</hi> 4.11. 2. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not to <hi>Abraham</hi> only but to his Children. 3. This bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing beſtowed on believing <hi>Abraham</hi> was to deſcend on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Gentiles, Gal.</hi> 3.14. For he was to be the <hi>Father of all them that believe, though they were not circumciſed,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us in the place fore-quoted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. Now could the <hi>believing Gentiles</hi> be <hi>heirs of this Covenant</hi> (according to promiſe as it is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29.) if their children be excluded from it? For the <hi>Childrens right to the Covenant and promiſe</hi> is part of the Fathers inheritance, the promiſe being, <hi>I will be a God to thee and thy ſeed.</hi> 4. Conſider, the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> hath alwayes been one and the ſame for ſubſtance, though not as to <hi>manner of Adminiſtration.</hi> And under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> it took in <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and can we think it leaves them out now under the Goſpel? Surely <hi>the grace</hi> of God is not <hi>ſtraiter</hi> under the Goſpel than it was under the Law: For Chriſt is <hi>the Mediator of a better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> as the Apoſtle tellls us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. that is, of a <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter adminiſtration of the Covenant of Grace.</hi> And how could this be, if <hi>infants</hi> who were within the Covenant under the Law, ſhould now be out of it under the Goſpel? But to clear this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yet further, the Apoſtle tells us that <hi>Children of believers are foederally holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.14. <hi>Elſe were your Children unclean,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:66289:111"/> but now are they holy.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, if <hi>both Parents</hi> were <hi>Heathens,</hi> then were their Children <hi>unclean,</hi> that is, <hi>out of Covenant;</hi> but now one of them being a Chriſtian, it pleaſes God that the Child ſhall have benefit and priviledge by <hi>that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; now are they holy,</hi> that is, in Covenant with God. And in this ſenſe; <hi>If the root be holy, ſo alſo are the branches, Rom.</hi> 11.16. If the Parents be <hi>holy,</hi> ſo alſo are the Children. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks not of an <hi>inward holineſs</hi> inhering in the nature of the Child, but of an <hi>outward holineſs</hi> or <hi>right</hi> to Church Priviledges and Ordinances. And according to this ſenſe, thoſe words of <hi>Ezra</hi> are to be underſtood, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.2. <hi>Ye have mingled the holy ſeed,</hi> that is, that are <hi>in Covenant,</hi> with the <hi>Nations,</hi> that is, with thoſe who are <hi>out of Covenant.</hi> I know, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret thoſe words of the Apoſtle <hi>[now are your Children holy]</hi> to import no more but this, <hi>they are legitimate and no baſtards.</hi> But that cannot be the meaning of them: For the Children then of many <hi>Pagans</hi> would be <hi>as holy as they:</hi> For multitudes of them are born in <hi>lawful Wedlock,</hi> and ſo no baſtards.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>viſible members</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church had a <hi>foederal right to</hi> the Sacraments, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2, 3, 4. <hi>They were all baptized into</hi> Moſes, <hi>all eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, and yet with many of them God was not well pleaſed.</hi> This <hi>foederal right</hi> did not ſtamp on them <hi>a character of ſaving grace,</hi> but was only a <hi>right</hi> to the means of Salvation, and how far God would make them <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> no man could tell. Some that had a <hi>right</hi> to them, made no <hi>right uſe of them.</hi> For an <hi>infant</hi> therefore to be born of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Parents <hi>profeſſing to believe in Chriſt, and willing ſolemnly to dedicate him to God,</hi> is all that God requires of an infant to give him <hi>Title</hi> to his Covenant.<note n="*" place="margin">Hypocrites may have a <hi>right to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Church priviledges</hi> though the <hi>Spiritual benefit</hi> do not belong to them, they not making a right uſe of them. <hi>No outward Ordinance</hi> is intended for the <hi>elect</hi> only.

And their <hi>Infants are in Covenant,</hi> becauſe <hi>reputatively</hi> their <hi>Parents wills</hi> are <hi>theirs,</hi> to diſpoſe of them for their good. And the Children are ſuppoſed to conſent by their Parents who conſent for them. And the Parents will is reckoned for the Childs, till he come to age, to have a will of his own. His Parents faith and conſent to dedicate him to God, is <hi>his Title.</hi> Now Parents
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:66289:111"/> dedicate their Children. 1. <hi>Virtually,</hi> when they dedicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God. 2. <hi>Actually</hi> when their hearts actually and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly conſent to dedicate <hi>this Child</hi> to God. 3. <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> when they bring him to baptiſm and ſolemnly there dedicate him to God. And this is the title of <hi>Children</hi> to baptiſm, and not their <hi>meer natural relation</hi> to their Parents.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Sponſors, God-fathers</hi> or <hi>witneſſes,</hi> probably the uſe of them in ancient time was this. They were ſuch as came to the Church, and profeſſed they believed the <hi>Parents</hi> were <hi>true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> and in caſe they did Apoſtatize or die, did promiſe to ſee to the <hi>Chriſtian education</hi> of the Child themſelves. But ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the <hi>Parents faith and conſent</hi> to dedicate their Child to God (and that either of one or both) conveys the <hi>right of baptiſm</hi> to the Child, ſo the Parents themſelves ought to be the principal <hi>dedicators</hi> of their Child to God in baptiſm. If <hi>God-fathers</hi> or <hi>Sponſors</hi> be choſen by them as their <hi>deputies</hi> to do it for them, it may poſſibly be admitted, but as this is generally uſed 'tis a matter more of <hi>ceremony</hi> and <hi>civility</hi> than of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> And as a learned man<note n="*" place="margin">Fuller in his Infants Advocate <hi>page 156.</hi>
                     </note> ſayes, <hi>God-fathers</hi> are generally like <hi>braſs andirons</hi> ſtanding more for <hi>ſight</hi> than <hi>ſervice,</hi> more for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than uſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Children were <hi>circumciſed under the Law,</hi> they may be <hi>baptized under the Goſpel.</hi> For <hi>baptiſm</hi> ſucceeds to all the <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi> of circumciſion. <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was not a meer badge of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Jews</hi> from other nations, but a <hi>Seal</hi> of their conſecration to God. It had more in it of what was <hi>Sacramental</hi> than of what was <hi>Ceremonial.</hi> And the <hi>chief my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> ſignified by circumciſion was, that <hi>natural corruption</hi> muſt be cut off and done away. Now Chriſtians are ſaid by baptiſm to be <hi>ſpiritually circumciſed. Ye are circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. He urges it as an argument to them to throw off the <hi>Jewiſh circumciſion,</hi> for they were circumciſed with the <hi>circumciſion of Chriſt,</hi> viz. <hi>with that which he had appointed in his Goſpel,</hi> and that was <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi> So that <hi>baptiſm</hi> is now come in the <hi>room of circumciſion.</hi> And as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>One generation paſſes away, and another comes, but the earth remains for ever;</hi> So may I ſay, <hi>one Sacrament</hi> of initiation, <hi>(viz. Circumciſion)</hi> paſſeth away, and another, <hi>(viz. Baptiſm)</hi> cometh in its ſtead, but yet the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:66289:112"/> 
                     <hi>ſame Covenant of Grace</hi> that was then, remaineth ſtill. So that what circumciſion was <hi>to them,</hi> our baptiſm is <hi>to us,</hi> as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was to be a <hi>ſign</hi> or <hi>token</hi> of the Covenant to them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. So is <hi>baptiſm</hi> to us, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Then Peter ſaid unto them, repent and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, &amp;c. For the promiſe is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was a <hi>Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith to them, Rom.</hi> 4.11. And ſo is <hi>baptiſm</hi> to us, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. <hi>Ariſe and be baptized and waſh away thy ſins, calling on the name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Circumciſion</hi> ſignified the neceſſity of <hi>ſanctification</hi> to them, and therefore they were required to be <hi>circumciſed alſo in heart, Rom.</hi> 2.29. So <hi>baptiſm</hi> to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Therefore we are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him by baptiſm into death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the difference between <hi>circumciſion</hi> and <hi>baptiſm</hi> is for our advantage. For 1. <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is not ſo painful as <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was. None of our blood is required here to be ſhed. 2. Baptiſm is not confined to the eighth day, but may be done before or after. 3. Women, and female children may be baptized, who could not be circumciſed. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.5. We read that <hi>Lydia</hi> was baptized. And <hi>Acts</hi> 18.1. 'tis ſaid <hi>they were baptiſed both men and women.</hi> But we come to a third argument for infant Baptiſm, and that is this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whole Families were baptiſed under the new Teſtament, as <hi>Lydia</hi> and her houſhold, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15. <hi>Stephanus</hi> and his houſhold, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. And the Jaylor and his houſhold, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31, 32. Can we imagine ſo many families without any Children in them?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Children are capable of receiving benefit by baptiſm, why ſhould they therefore be kept from it? The benefits of Baptiſm are. 1. <hi>Remiſſion of ſin by the blood of Chriſt;</hi> and children need that remiſſion, by reaſon of original ſin. 2. <hi>Sanctification by the Spirit of Chriſt;</hi> and they need the Sanctifying of the Spirit to renew their natures. And Chriſt may in the due adminiſtraion
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:66289:112"/> of this Ordinance graciouſly work on the Soul of an Infant, and change its diſpoſition, and infuſe the ſeeds of grace into it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes to the uſe of reaſon, why then ſhould not children be brought to Chriſt, and dedicated to him by baptiſm? Surely they that keep them from <hi>him,</hi> dangerouſly expoſe them to the grand enemy of their Souls.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth and laſt argument I ſhall bring for Infant Baptiſm, ſhall be the practice of the Church in ancient times, and near to the Apoſtolical. And for proofs of this nature, I ſhall take my riſe from the time of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> without looking lower, and ſo aſcend toward the days of the Apoſtles.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And thus far we can go, to ſhew the antient practice of the Church concerning Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We come now to the fifth thing we propounded to inquire into, and that is, whether baptiſm be of abſolute neceſſity to Salvation?</p>
                  <p>Baptiſm is not of ſuch abſolute neceſſity, that they that partake not of it, muſt certainly and unavoidably periſh. The <hi>penitent Thief</hi> on the Croſs (who was then converted) ſurely never was baptized. And <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of it ſelf does not <hi>confer grace,</hi> For <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13, 23. <hi>Simon Magus was baptized, yet remained in the gall of bitterneſs.</hi> God can confer grace <hi>as</hi> he pleaſes, and <hi>when</hi> he pleaſes. He ties <hi>us,</hi> but not <hi>himſelf</hi> to the uſe of means. Baptiſm is <hi>generally</hi> and <hi>ordinarily</hi> neceſſary to ſalvation, both <hi>neceſſitate praecepti</hi> and <hi>medii;</hi> ſurely Chriſt would not command a needleſs thing to all nations in the name of the bleſſed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. We cannot ordinarily expect grace, but in the uſe of the means of grace, which he hath appointed. 'Tis not therefore the ſimple <hi>privation,</hi> but the <hi>neglect</hi> or <hi>contempt</hi> of baptiſm, that is dangerous. And ſo I come now to the ſixth thing I propounded to inquire into, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>What improvement ſhould they make of their baptiſm who were baptized in their Infancy?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. They ſhould reflect upon their <hi>Original corruption,</hi> and how defiled they were from the Womb, ſo that as ſoon as they were born they ſtood in need of a Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It ſhould mind them, that <hi>long ago</hi> they were ſolemnly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Chriſt, entred into his family, liſted under his banner, engaged (as far as could be done by their Parents) to the ſincere ſervice and worſhip of God the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and to forſake the <hi>Devil, the World and the Fleſh.</hi> But now they are come to years of underſtanding, they muſt renew <hi>their Covenant</hi> with Chriſt by their own actual conſent. And ſurely if things were regularly carried in the Church (as they ought to be) the paſſing out of the <hi>Infant ſtate</hi> of Church-member-ſhip into the ſtate of <hi>adult members</hi> ſhould be very <hi>Solemn,</hi> and by a <hi>ſerious,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:66289:114"/> underſtanding, perſonal</hi> owning of their <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant;</hi> and then they ſhould be confirmed in the ſtate of adult members, and then, and not before be admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. The <hi>infant baptiſmal Covenant</hi> will ſave none that live to years of diſcretion, that do not heartily own it in their own perſons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It ſhould ſtir up Godly ſorrow in them, that being ſo long ago ingaged unto Chriſt, and dedicated to him by their <hi>Parents,</hi> they have walked no more anſwerably thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It ſhould ſtir up in them a vigorous exerciſe of Faith in Chriſts blood. Did they need Chriſts <hi>merits</hi> and <hi>interceſſion</hi> when young, and when they were under the guilt only of original ſin; how much more now do they need it, when they have committed ſo many actual ſins?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The remembrance of his baptiſm ſhould be a mighty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to turn a ſinner from the error of his way. Say to thy Soul (O Sinner) I was dedicated to Chriſt in my Infancy, and now ſhall I go on in ſin ſerving the Devil? I was liſted under the banner of Chriſt; and ſhall I now fight againſt him? Ah wretch! how can I do theſe things?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It ſhould be a great antidote againſt temptation: whenever thou art tempted to ſin, ſay to thy ſelf, <hi>I am baptized, I am ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ingaged unto Chriſt,</hi> how can I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt him?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I come now to the ſeventh and laſt thing I propounded to conſider, namely, <hi>What are the duties of Chriſtian Parents in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their Children.</hi> Their duties are theſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To be ſenſible of <hi>their own</hi> ſinful condition by nature, and how they have been inſtruments of propagating a corrupt nature to their poor Children.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To bleſs God for Chriſt, who is the the only Phyſician, who can cure <hi>them</hi> and <hi>their children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seaſonably to preſent their Children to this ordinance of <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> and profeſſing their Faith in Chriſt, and their conſent to take him for their Lord and Saviour, ſolemnly to dedicate them unto him: And when they dedicate their children unto Chriſt, they ſhould addreſs themſelves unto it as one of the <hi>ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt</hi> works in the world. They ſhould do it with due prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:66289:114"/> reverence, and ſeriouſneſs as beſeemeth thoſe that are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting a buſineſs, of ſuch unſpeakable importance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They ſhould ingage to bring up their children in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Chriſtian Faith. They ſhould imagine God ſaid to them as the daughter of <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes's</hi> Mother, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Bring up this Child for me.</hi> Bring up this Child in my fear, and for my ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They ſhould be very earneſt in prayer to God for their children. O that <hi>Iſmael might live in thy ſight,</hi> ſayes holy <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 17.18. So ſhould pious Parents pray for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, O that this child of mine may be a real member of Chriſt. O that he may have the Image of God ſtamped upon his Soul. O that he may honour God here, and be for ever happy with him in his Kingdom hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They ſhould be early inſtilling <hi>good and wholſome principles</hi> and <hi>documents</hi> into them; <hi>precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little and there a little, as they are able to bear it, Iſa.</hi> 28.10. And the <hi>Mother</hi> as well as the <hi>Father</hi> ſhould make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to do this. We read that <hi>Bathſheba</hi> the mother of <hi>Solomon</hi> did ſo, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. which chapter contains her wiſe inſtructions to him.<note n="*" place="margin">And if it be the duty of Parents thus carefully to inſtruct their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then ſurely 'tis the duty of Children carefully to obſerve and lay to heart, and practice the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of their Parents.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. They ſhould check the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and buddings forth of ſin in them, endeavouring to make them ſenſible of the great evil and danger of it.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They ſhould labour to make them in love with the beauty and excellency of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="10">10.

                  <p>That you may therefore be rightly informed concerning the nature of this Sacrament, you muſt know, that the <hi>Jews</hi> had two ordinary ſtanding Sacraments. <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> to which Our <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> do anſwer.</item>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theirs were bloody Sacraments; for the blood of Chriſt was to be ſhed. Ours unbloody; for the blood of Chriſt is ſhed. Now that I may ſpeak more diſtinctly and plainly concening the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, it will be requiſite that I ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing 1. concerning the <hi>Jewiſh Paſsover,</hi> which we ſhall conſider either as it was <hi>firſt inſtituted</hi> or as it was <hi>afterwards celebrated,</hi> wherein divers rites of the firſt <hi>Aegyptian Paſsover</hi> were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerved.</p>
                  <p>The firſt inſtitution of the <hi>Paſsover</hi> we find, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> after long ſervitude and bondage was to go out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> God commanded them in their ſeveral families <hi>to kill a Lamb;</hi> to roaſt it whole; to eat it within doors that night; to ſprinkle the ſide and upper door-poſts with the blood thereof; and ſo doing, they ſhould be ſafe from the deſtroying Angel, that rode circuit that night to deſtroy all <hi>Egypts firſt born,</hi> but he was to paſs by all the houſes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſprinkled with blood. And hence the name <hi>Paſsover, Exod.</hi> 12.27. This was to be greatly obſerved on the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth, at Even.</p>
                  <p>In the treating therefore of <hi>this Paſsover</hi> we ſhall firſt conſider the <hi>things</hi> that were proper to the <hi>Jewiſh Paſsover</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and then ſhew how they prefigured Chriſt our <hi>Paſsover.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. They were commanded to take a Lamb. A Lamb the emblem of innocency. So our Saviour was ſtiled, <hi>John</hi> 1.19. <hi>The
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:66289:115"/> Lamb of God,</hi> being of a <hi>Lamb-like</hi> humility and meekneſs. <hi>John</hi> his beloved Diſciple often ſtiles him ſo, as being exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delighted with this ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Lamb without blemiſh. So was our Saviour, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. One of their own flocks and folds. Chriſt was of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5. Like in all things to his brethren, ſin only excepted.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It muſt be ſlain. So Chriſt was put to death on the Croſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Not a bone of it muſt be broken, which was verified in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 19.33, 36.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It muſt be roaſted. So our Saviour ſuffered the ſcorching heat of his Fathers wrath; ſweating drops of blood for our ſakes, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. O <hi>Sinner</hi> how little art thou ſenſible of what thy Saviour hath ſuffered to redeem thee!</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The blood of the Lamb muſt be ſprinkled on the ſide and upper door-poſts of their houſes, if they intended to be preſerved from the deſtroying Angel. So muſt the blood of Chriſt be ſprinkled by Faith on our hearts, if we intend to be delivered from the wrath to come.<note place="margin">See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>and Heb.</hi> 12.24</note> There is no eſcaping the wrath of God, but by the ſprinkling of Chriſts blood on our conſciences.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They were to eat this Paſchal Lamb with <hi>ſower herbs</hi> and <hi>unlevened bread.</hi> 1. With <hi>ſower herbs,</hi> to mind them of what affliction and bondage they were in in <hi>Egypt.</hi> We muſt have contrition and remorſe wrought in us for our ſins, and be in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of ſoul for them, ere we can reaſonably expect relief by Chriſt. 2.

                  <p>From whence we may take notice, that we are not bound to obſerve all <hi>occaſional</hi> or <hi>local circumſtances</hi> or <hi>cuſtoms</hi> belonging to a Sacrament, nor to follow our Saviour and his Apoſtles in thoſe particular circumſtances of eating the Lords Supper late at night, or in a leaning poſture, or in an upper Chamber, no woman being preſent, &amp;c. Let us look to the <hi>ſubſtance, end,</hi> and <hi>intent</hi> of the Sacrament, and chiefly mind that.</p>
                  <p>Having ſpoken thus much of the <hi>Paſsover,</hi> I think it will not be amiſs for the clearer underſtanding of the <hi>original inſtitution</hi> of this Sacrament of the Lords Supper, to inſert a ſhort deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the method and order of the Paſchal Supper with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>rites</hi> thereunto belonging (which were then either <hi>all</hi> or <hi>moſt of them,</hi> as it ſeems, in uſe among the <hi>Jews</hi>) as they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us by their own writers, much after this manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:66289:117"/> in ſeveral Cups, or <hi>drinkings of Wine, and two breakings of bread.</hi> Some of which rites, we ſhall ſhew, that our Saviour took and ordained them to a new <hi>Evangelical uſe</hi> and myſtical ſignification.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When all things appertaining to the <hi>Feaſt</hi> were prepared, and all perſons belonging to that Company that were to eat together, were ready, the <hi>chief man</hi> of the company (who was as it were the Prieſt among them) takes a <hi>cup of Wine</hi> and bleſſes it in ſome ſuch words as theſe. <hi>Bleſſed be thou Lord, who haſt created the fruit of the vine,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed be thou for this good day, and this holy convocation, &amp;c.</hi> Compare with this cuſtome our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours words, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.17. <hi>He took the Cup and gave thanks and ſaid, take this and divide it among you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then the Table was furniſhed with proviſions of ſeveral ſorts, <hi>viz. bitter herbs,</hi> the <hi>unlevened bread,</hi> the <hi>body of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb roaſted whole,</hi> and ſo brought up.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The chief man of the company takes the ſower herbs and bleſſes them in ſome ſuch words as theſe, <hi>Bleſſed art thou O Lord, who createſt the fruits of the earth, &amp;c.</hi> and then eats of them the quantity of an Olive at leaſt, and diſtributes to the reſt, uttering ſome ſuch ſentence as this, <hi>Theſe bitter herbs we eat in token that the Egyptians made the lives of our Fathers bitter in Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then he takes the diſh or Charger which held the <hi>unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread</hi> or <hi>Cakes,</hi> and (laying by a piece thereof to be eaten afterwards with the Paſchal Lamb at the cloſe of the Supper) he bleſſed the bread in ſome ſuch words as theſe, <hi>bleſſed art thou O Lord, who bringeſt forth bread out of the earth, &amp;c.</hi> Then he breaks it, and eats of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When this is finiſhed, he begins the ſecond Cup of Wine, and the reſt follow him. Then their Children brought in, were made to ask <hi>what is the reaſon that this night differs ſo much from other nights,</hi> inſtancing in many particulars of the feſtival ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities? Then the maſter of the feaſt begins a a <hi>narrative,</hi> how their Fathers were all ſervants in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>as that night</hi> God delivered them, &amp;c. And tells particularly of the wonders done in <hi>Egypt</hi> and the manner of their deliverance, ſaying to this purpoſe, <hi>This is the Paſsover which we celebrate, becauſe the Lord paſſed over the houſes of our Fathers in Egypt; therefore we are bound to give thanks, to praiſe, to laud and glorify him,</hi> and ſing <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:66289:117"/> him, &amp;c. This kind of declaration or ſhewing forth the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Paſsover,</hi> they called <hi>Haggadah.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle may be ſuppoſed to have borrowed his phraſe. <hi>As oft as ye eat this bread and drink this Cup, ye declare or ſet forth the Lords death,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. This <hi>annunciation</hi> or ſhewing forth to their Children the Lords wonderful goodneſs and mercy to them, we find commanded <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.26, 27. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, when your children ſhall ſay unto you, what mean you by this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? That ye ſhall ſay, it is the Sacrifice of the Lords Paſsover, who paſſed over the houſes of the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in</hi> Egypt, <hi>when he ſmote the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and delivered our houſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Then he takes that part of the unlevened cake that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſerved, and bleſſing it, and <hi>giving thanks</hi> for it as before, he diſtributes to every one a piece of it to eat with the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> of which each perſon preſent was bound to eat as much as the quantity of an Olive at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>breaking of bread</hi> therefore, at which our Saviour did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the commemoration of his body, ſeems to be <hi>this ſecond breaking of bread, viz.</hi> in time of Supper, after which nothing more was to be eaten that night. For 'tis ſaid, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>as they were eating,</hi> or towards the end of the Supper, <hi>Jeſus took bread and bleſſed it and brake it and gave it to his Diſciples ſaying, take eat this is my body, Mat.</hi> 26.26.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. All this done, they drink up the <hi>third Cup,</hi> called the <hi>Cup of bleſſing, or thanksgiving after meat, Paul</hi> calls it by this very name, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The Cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>this third Cup</hi> which was after ſupper (that is, after they had done eating, and was the concluſion of the Supper) was <hi>the Cup</hi> which our Saviour applied to a new ſpiritual ſignification. And having inſtituted it into an <hi>Euchariſtical Cup,</hi> bad them drink all of it. So that now he ordaines <hi>bread</hi> to be a repreſentation of his body hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in the ſame manner as the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> had been the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of his body before; and the <hi>cup</hi> to be the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in his blood now, as the blood of bullocks had been <hi>the Old Teſtament</hi> in his blood before, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.8. <hi>And Moſes took the blood and ſprinkled it on the people, and ſaid, behold the blood of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with you,</hi> &amp;c. After this they ſang the <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> or Hymn, or Pſalm of Praiſe, according
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:66289:118"/> to Cuſtom. And accordingly our Saviour and his Apoſtles did ſing a hymn after the Paſchal Supper before they departed. So that ſuppoſing theſe Rites to be then in uſe among the <hi>Jews</hi> (as their own writers tell us) it will from thence appear, that the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> which our Saviour diſtributed at his <hi>laſt Paſsover,</hi> and appointed to ſignifie and repreſent his <hi>body</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> were <hi>rites</hi> within the compaſs of it, and belonging to it, only appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him now to a <hi>new evangelical uſe</hi> and <hi>ſignification.</hi> And he dealt no otherwiſe in this Sacrament, than he did before in that other of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which he ſeems to have founded upon the old rite in uſe among the <hi>Jews,</hi> of <hi>purification by water.</hi> So that our Saviour in inſtituting <hi>both Sacaments</hi> of the <hi>new Teſtament</hi> ſeems to have taken the <hi>old rites</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and advanced them to a <hi>new evangelical uſe,</hi> and <hi>myſtical ſignification,</hi> and ſo to have put (as one ſayes) a new ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription upon the old metal. There is one thing more that it will not be amiſs here to take notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> That from the <hi>Jewiſh cuſtom of having a feaſt at the end of their Sacrifices,</hi> the Chriſtians of the Primitive Church inſtituted their <hi>Agapae</hi> or <hi>love feaſts.</hi> And they of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> did much imitate the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paſchal rites in receiving of the Lords Supper. For they had a Supper before (in which they were not always very tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as appears 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) And at the concluſion of this Supper they had the bread and wine of the Lords Supper admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, as the <hi>Jews</hi> at the end of their Paſchal Supper had the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levened bread,</hi> and the <hi>Cup of bleſſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having ſpoken thus much of the <hi>Paſsover</hi> and the <hi>rites</hi> belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to it; I now come to ſpeak of the Lords Supper which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds it. And here I ſhall treat,

                        <item>1. Of the Author of it.</item>
                        <item>2. Of the time when it was inſtituted.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt himſelf is the Author of it. We have before ſhewn how Chriſt eating the Paſchal Supper with his Diſciples (who were <hi>Jews</hi>) took ſome of the Paſchal cheer and proviſions, and made them the materials of this bleſſed Sacrament. 'Tis Chriſt who was the <hi>Author</hi> of it. 'Tis he who is the King and Soveraign of his Church. 'Tis he who appoints therein his <hi>Officers,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:66289:118"/> Laws,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances.</hi> He is the <hi>Mediator</hi> of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and therefore appoints the <hi>tokens</hi> and <hi>ſeals</hi> of it. <hi>Divine inſtitution</hi> only makes a Sacrament; the whole Church cannot do it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us conſider the time in which it was inſtituted, <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſame night in which he was betrayed by <hi>Judas,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. Obſerve Chriſts great love to his Church. He ſaw his death approaching; yet he beſtows now a <hi>great favour</hi> on mankind, when he ſees he ſhall receive the hardeſt meaſure from them. O that the ſame mind were in us that was in Chriſt Jeſus! <hi>Judas</hi> had reſolved beforehand to betray him, and accordingly had agreed with the Chief-Prieſts and Council of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet with this wicked reſolution he comes to eat the Paſsover with him. Sins of purpoſe and reſolution are moſt dangerous. We ſhould look not only on <hi>Judas's</hi> ſin in betraying his Maſter, but on his fixed intention and reſolution to do it. 'Tis a dangerous thing to come to this Sacrament with an intent to go on in any known ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us conſider the nature of this Sacrament; wherein three things are to be ſpoken to.</p>

                     <item>2. The <hi>inward and Spiritual myſteries thereby ſignified.</hi>

                  <p>So that the duty of a Miniſter who ſhall according to Chriſts inſtitution adminiſter this Ordinance, is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To praiſe God for the elements of bread and wine; and ſetting them apart; (according to Chriſts inſtitution) from a <hi>common</hi> to this <hi>religious uſe,</hi> to pray to God that they may be <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual repreſentations, ſigns</hi> and <hi>ſeals</hi> of the ſpiritual bleſſings they are appointed to ſignifie, to all thoſe who ſhall receive them in a right manner.

Here Chriſt is repreſented to us as <hi>Sacrificed</hi> for us, and delivering himſelf to us with the fruits and benefits of his death, for our eternal good. <hi>I ſay</hi>
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:66289:119"/> (ſayes our Saviour.) <hi>This is my body which was broken</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The body of Chriſt that was nailed to the Croſs, and his blood that was ſhed, was a Sacrifice, as offered up to God. But it is <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> as offered to us.

Chriſt ſayes <hi>my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</hi> And verſe 56. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him,</hi> that is, He dwelleth in me <hi>by Faith,</hi> and I dwell in him by the conſtant influence and quickning vertue of my holy Spirit.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as meat is received by our mouth and taſted by our Palate, and ſo turned into our ſubſtance. Being ſo received, he will ſtrengthen and refreſh our Souls as meat doth a hungry man. There is an abſolute neceſſity of cloſing with Chriſt <hi>as crucified</hi> and of being highly pleaſed with him on that account, as the Palate is with wholſom agreeable food, that our Souls being united to him may of his fulneſs receive grace for grace. Not that we muſt be like the groſs <hi>Capernaites (John</hi> 6.) who had a groſs appehenſion of eating corporally the very fleſh and drinking the very blood of Chriſt There is indeed a <hi>ſpiritual eating of Chriſts fleſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his blood by Faith,</hi> which may be exerciſed when this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not adminiſtred. And <hi>of ſuch an eating</hi> our Saviour ſpeaks to the <hi>Jews, John</hi> 6.53. <hi>Verily verily I ſay unto you, except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> Now that he does not mean <hi>Sacramental</hi> eating there, is plain and evident; for that <hi>Sacrament</hi> was not inſtituted till a good while after this, as will appear to any one who underſtands the hiſtory of our Saviour; nay this kind of eating of his fleſh by Faith he ſhews to be of ſo great neceſſity, that without it he tells them <hi>they had no life in them,</hi> v. 53. which cannot be ſaid of all that never received the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we approach to this holy Table, let us not be like the Carnal <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that did <hi>eat Manna</hi> and <hi>drink of the rock</hi> in the wilderneſs, but neither ſaw nor taſted Chriſt in them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We come now to conſider the command for the obſerving of this ordinance. <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is not to be extended to <hi>circumſtances,</hi> and <hi>acceſſaries</hi> but to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:66289:120"/> the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and <hi>main</hi> of the inſtitution. This Sacrament is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> from the time of the firſt inſtitution, not that we are bound to receive it only at that time. Occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal circumſtances the prudence of the Church may alter, let us look to the <hi>ſubſtance, end</hi> and <hi>intent</hi> of this Sacrament, and chiefly mind that. The dying charge of a Friend does uſually make great impreſſion on the by-ſtanders. And ſo ſhould this ſolemn charge of our dying Saviour make upon us. <hi>Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me</hi> and obſerve it in all ages <hi>till I come.</hi> So long it muſt be continued in the world.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us conſider now the ends for which this Sacrament was ordained. And here I ſhall ſpeak.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of the true and proper ends for which it was inſtituted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of the miſtaken ends for which it was not appointed.</p>
                  <p>The true and proper ends for which it was inſtituted are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To be a ſolemn commemoration of the death and paſſion of our Lord and Saviour, to keep it in remembrance, and in the eye of the Church till he come to Judgment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To be a Seal of the <hi>new Covenant</hi> or <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> with all the promiſes and priviledges of it, and of the ratification of it by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my blood,</hi> that is, a <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi> of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Covenant which is to be ratified and confirmed by my blood.<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. <hi>This is my blood of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is now to be ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins:</hi> that is, <hi>this wine</hi> in the Cup is a <hi>ſign</hi> or <hi>repreſentation</hi> of my blood, and a ſeal whereby the new Covenant is confirmed with all the promiſes of it. For <hi>without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22.</note> Gods Juſtice being no other way to be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Now the Sacraments may be ſaid to be <hi>Seals</hi> in two reſpects, 1. They are <hi>abſolute ſeals</hi> to the <hi>veracity</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Covenant. 2. <hi>Conditional Seals</hi> in reference to us. They Seal the remiſſion of ſins to all that perform the conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and to none elſe: As the <hi>tree of life</hi> did not ſeal or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to <hi>Adam,</hi> that he ſhould have life, except upon condition of his perfect obedience. To them therefore that perform the conditions required they <hi>exhibit, confer</hi> and <hi>paſsover</hi> the bleſſings promiſed in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To be an <hi>objective means</hi> to ſtir up, excite and increaſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:66289:120"/> Faith, Love, Hope, Joy, Thankfulneſs</hi> in believers, by a lively repreſentation of the <hi>evil of ſin,</hi> the infinite <hi>love</hi> of God in Chriſt, the <hi>firmneſs</hi> of the Covenant of grace, the <hi>greatneſs</hi> and <hi>ſureneſs</hi> of the mercies promiſed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To be a <hi>badge</hi> and <hi>cognizance</hi> of the Church before the world; and a token that we ſolemnly profeſs that we own a <hi>crucified Jeſus</hi> for our Saviour, and that 'tis Chriſt and his death that we depend upon and abide by, for the remiſſion of all our ſins and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To be a means of our renewing our Covenant with God. <hi>Covenants</hi> in the Scripture were wont to be made by <hi>eating and drinking together. Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Abimelech, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded their Covenants with a Feaſt.<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.30. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.44, 46.</note> Hereby we have an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of entring into a ſtricter engagement to God, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant we made with him in Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To be a means of procuring and advancing <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>love</hi> among the Saints. A feaſt carries in it the notion of love and good will. But this is more a <hi>feaſt of love</hi> than any ordinary feaſt can be, becauſe 'tis a remembrance of the greateſt love that that ever was manifeſted, <hi>viz.</hi> of that love which the Lord ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in dying for us. 'Tis a <hi>Feaſt upon Chriſts Sacrifice.</hi> And it ſhould be a means not only of uniting believers more firmly to Chriſt their Head, but of uniting and endearing them more one to another.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Chriſtians did notably expreſs this. 1. By <hi>their Agapae</hi> or love-feaſt, <hi>Jude</hi> verſe 14. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. 2. By their kiſs of Charity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.30. 3. By their col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections for the poor made at theſe times, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1.</p>
                  <p>Having thus ſpoken of the true and proper ends for which this Sacrament was inſtituted; I come now to conſider the miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ends for which it was not appointed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was not appointed to turn <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> into the <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>real body and blood of Chriſt.</hi> For if <hi>ſenſe</hi> be not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved concerning its own object, and which tells all men that 'tis <hi>ſtill bread</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> how can we believe that Chriſt or any of his Apoſtles were ever in the World, ſeeing they that ſaw them and converſed with them, may on this ground for all that be deceived; which were very irrational to imagine. And the Apoſtle expreſly calls it <hi>bread</hi> three times in three verſes together, and that after the Conſecration. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26, 27, 28. <hi>For as often as ye eat this
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:66289:121"/> bread and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come. Wherefore whoſoever ſhall eat this Bread and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily ſhall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of this Bread, and drink of that Cup.</hi> And he tells us, that the uſe of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not to make the <hi>Lards Body corporally preſent,</hi> but <hi>to ſhew the Lords death till he come;</hi> that is, to be a viſible repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation and commemoration of his death till he come to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Indeed Chriſt is really preſent in this Sacrament, but not <hi>in the elements,</hi> but <hi>to the Faith of the worthy receiver.</hi> When they eat of this Bread and drink of this Cup in a due manner, exerciſing a lively Faith in him for the remiſſion of all their ſins, Chriſt is then preſent to their <hi>Faith,</hi> neither is he any otherwiſe preſent in this Sacrament.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Sacrament was not appointed to Sacrifice Chriſt really again to the Father, to propitiate him for the quick and dead, or to eaſe Souls in Purgatory, to deliver them out of it. For Chriſt <hi>having died once,</hi> dieth no more, but by once offering up himſelf hath for ever <hi>perfected them that are ſanctified,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14.</note> that is, he hath made a perfect ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God, and done all things needful to bring them to eternal life, who are ſanctified by his grace, and brought to believe in him with a lively Faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis not appointed as <hi>a means to conveigh grace</hi> meerly by the work done, or by the outward receiving of it only, (as charms are ſuppoſed to work;) neither are we to ſuppoſe that God will pardon or ſave any for their meer coming to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, though they ſtrive not with their hearts to bring them to repentance, faith in Chriſt, ſincere love to God and men, and new obedience.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. 'Tis not appointed as a means to wipe off the old ſcore of ſin that men may more freely and boldly encourage themſelves to ſin again (as ſome ignorant people are apt to think) but as a bleſſed means to mortifie ſin in us and to engage us unto holineſs. And thus much concerning the <hi>firſt head</hi> I propounded to ſpeak unto, <hi>viz. The right informing the judgment;</hi> and that concerning theſe four particulars. 1. <hi>The author of this Sacrament.</hi> 2. <hi>The time of its Inſtitution.</hi> 3. <hi>The nature of it.</hi> 4. <hi>The ends for which it was appointed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to the <hi>ſecond, viz.</hi> to direct your practice and to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:66289:121"/> ſhew you how you ſhould receive it in a <hi>right manner.</hi> In order to which you muſt know,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>There are ſome duties to be performed before you come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this holy Sacrament.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Some duties in the time of receiving it.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>There are two kinds of preparation neceſſary to a worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>General</hi> which is that we look to it, that we be in a <hi>ſtate of grace;</hi> for there are ſeveral <hi>graces</hi> that muſt be exerciſed in receiving this Sacrament, and they that are not in a ſtate of grace are utterly unfit (for the preſent) to approach this holy Table.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Particular</hi> which conſiſts in <hi>a preſent actual fulneſs.</hi> In order to the obtaining of this let me adviſe thee (Reader) to the practice of theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Betake thy ſelf to ſome retired privacy, and ſequeſtring thy ſelf from worldly cares and buſineſs, labour to bring thy mind into a good <hi>calm ſedate</hi> frame and fitneſs for this great work.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Earneſtly beg of God to give thee the <hi>aſſiſtance of his holy ſpirit</hi> to inable thee to fit thy ſelf for this ſolemn Ordinance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seriouſly conſider the danger of receiving this Sacrament <hi>unworthily,</hi> that is, without ſuch a diſpoſition of mind and ſuch a preparation of heart, and ſuch reverence and devotion as is agreeable unto ſo holy an Ordinance. Such perſons as are not ſo fitted, and yet approach to this holy Table, are guilty of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning</hi> this Sacrament (which is the commemoration of Chriſts death) and of <hi>vilifying the ſigns and pledges of his body and blood,</hi> and ſo incur the danger of <hi>temporal Judgment</hi> and chaſtiſement here, and without repentance, of <hi>eternal</hi> hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Seriouſly conſider what is required to a <hi>worthy receiving.</hi> And here a twofold caution is to be obſerved. 1. That the <hi>pitch of worthineſs</hi> is not to be ſet too high, ſo as none ſhall be thought ſit to partake of this Table but ſuch as have a high and <hi>eminent degree of grace.</hi> For this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> perſon, though very ignorant of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:66289:122"/> the true nature and end of this ordinance, if he be free from <hi>groſs, open, and ſcandalous ſins,</hi> may be thought fit to come and be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it.</p>
                  <p>That we may therefore avoid both theſe, I ſhall ſet down.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>What qualifications are requiſite to a worthy Receiver?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>What are inſufficient?</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The qualifications requiſite are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Knowledge.</hi> The <hi>fundamental principles</hi> and grounds of Chriſtianity, and the <hi>nature, ſignification, end</hi> and <hi>uſe of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> muſt be known by every one that would be a worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver. <hi>Ignorant</hi> perſons therefore are totally unfit (for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) and muſt firſt be inſtructed before they be admitted to this holy Ordinance. But by the <hi>knowledge required</hi> we do not mean the <hi>profound knowledge of a Scholar</hi> (who knows how to diſpute upon any of theſe points, and knows all the diſtinctions about them) but the <hi>ſavoury knowledge of a Chriſtian,</hi> which hath theſe properties. 1. 'Tis not a meer ſpeculative floating or ſwimming in the brain, but a knowledge that <hi>affects</hi> the heart and works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the affections. 'Tis ſuch a knowledge of God, as cauſes the heart to fear him, ſuch a knowledge of ſin as works in the heart a <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>loathing</hi> of it. 2. 'Tis an humbling knowledge. Knowledge not ſanctified <hi>puffeth up,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1. But the more any Soul is <hi>ſavingly inlightned,</hi> the more it ſees, and is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of its own folly and corruption and great depravedneſs. 3. 'Tis a knowledge that is <hi>operative</hi> for the drawing the Soul to Chriſt, and for the mending of the heart and reforming of the life. Never let any man tell me that he has knowledge enough, he knows as much as the Miniſter can teach him, he knows the way to Heaven and Salvation as well as any body can ſhew him, when I ſee him going on in paths leading down to Hell. Shall any man perſwade me that he has a ſufficient skill in Phyſick, and yet when he is dangerouſly ſick, he is neither ſenſible of it, nor applies any fit remedy for himſelf? Certainly that knowledge of the things of God is not right, which does not affect the heart, nor reform the life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Repentance.</hi> They that are truly <hi>penitent</hi> have wrought in them by the Spirit of God. 1. A <hi>Conviction</hi> of the evil and danger of their ſins. 2. True contrition and godly ſorrow for them. 3. A hatred and loathing of them. 4. They are brought
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:66289:122"/> humbly to confeſs them with ſorrow and ſhame unto God. And 5. To turn from them unto God by ſincere amendment of their lives.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Faith in Chriſt.</hi> This is a main qualification requiſite to a worthy Communicant. The <hi>main acts of Faith are theſe two.</hi> 1. A ſerious <hi>owning</hi> and <hi>acknowledging</hi> Chriſt for the only Saviour of the World. 2. A ſincere <hi>giving up of the ſoul</hi> to him to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in his blood and ſanctified by his Spirit, and a ſolemn truſting and depending on him for all the benefits purchaſed by his death and paſſion. And ſuch a faith as this is operative for the purifying of the heart and reforming the life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Love.</hi> Of this grace there are <hi>ſeveral acts</hi> required. 1. We ought to excite a great love in our Souls to God our <hi>Creator</hi> and conſtant <hi>benefactor,</hi> who ſent his Son to redeem us. 2. We ought to excite and ſtir up in our ſouls a great love to <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who humbled himſelf to the death for us. In contemplation of which tranſcendent love of Chriſt the Apoſtle cries out, <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus let him be Anathema Maranatha,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22.</p>
                  <p>Q. But you will ſay, how may we know whether there be in us a <hi>ſincere love</hi> to Chriſt or no? 1. Have we been deeply <hi>wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with a ſence of our ſins, and have we betaken our ſelves to him as our only <hi>Phyſician</hi> to be cured, and have we found him cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our accuſing condemning conſciences? Hath our love to Chriſt any ſuch foundation as this? 2. Do we own Chriſt and love him as conſidered <hi>in all his Offices?</hi> Do we love Chriſt not only as a <hi>Prieſt</hi> that has made atonement for us, but as a <hi>Prophet</hi> and a <hi>King?</hi> Do we love the guidance of his holy Spirit and the guidance of his word? Do we love his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> as well as his <hi>Saviour-ſhip?</hi> 3. Do we love him for his deep humiliation and bitter ſufferings, which he ſo readily underwent for us, and for the great redemption and ſalvation he hath wrought for us? 4. Are we willing to obey Chriſt? <hi>If you love me</hi> (ſayes our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) <hi>keep my commandments?</hi> 5. Is the intereſt of Chriſt dear to us? Are we concerned in his honour and diſhonour? Are we <hi>ſuitably affected</hi> when his intereſt proſpers or is trampled upon, when it goes <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> with his Church? 6. Do we love him for thoſe eminent graces which were ſo conſpicuous in his life? 7. Are we willing to be ſerviceable to him and to ſuffer for him when he calls us to it? 8. Do we love him for his conſtant <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:66289:123"/> for us at Gods right hand? Let us try our love to Chriſt by theſe marks.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ought to have in our hearts a true love and charity to <hi>all Chriſtians.</hi> We ſhould excite in our Souls a true love to all thoſe that are real members of Chriſt. We ſhould love their <hi>perſons, graces, and fellowſhip.</hi> Theſe we ſhould love with a <hi>complacential love.</hi> But beſides theſe, we ſhould love our very <hi>enemies</hi> with a love of <hi>benevolence,</hi> wiſhing well <hi>unfeignedly</hi> to them and praying for them. The proper offices and effects of <hi>this Charity</hi> are 1. Forgiving injuries. 2. Doing good againſt evil. 3. Speaking good of others (if we can honeſtly) or elſe abſtaining from ſpeaking evil. Let us conſider what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayes, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.9. <hi>He that ſaith he is in the light, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his brother, is in darkneſs, even until now. He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occaſion of ſtumbling in him. He that hateth his brother is a Murderer.</hi> So that it ſeems there is a kind of <hi>heart-murder and tongue-murder,</hi> (which we ought to take heed of) as well as the <hi>murder of the hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth thing requiſite to a worthy Receiver is <hi>an hungring</hi> and thirſting <hi>after a greater ſence of Gods pardoning mercy in Chriſt, and of more communications of Grace from him,</hi> by which we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to live more unto God. Having thus ſhewed what are the due <hi>qualifications</hi> requiſite to a worthy Receiver; I come now to ſhew what qualifications are inſufficient.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He that is <hi>meerly civil</hi> is not ſufficiently qualified to partake of this Ordinance. By <hi>meerly civil</hi> I mean a perſon whoſe life as (as to men) is outwardly fair and civil; yet he hath never had any <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual conviction</hi> of the <hi>evil of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n,</hi> nor of the danger of his <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and actual</hi> tranſgreſſions made upon his conſcience, nor of the <hi>abſolute nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſſity</hi> that lies upon him to go out of himſelf to Chriſt for pardon: but uſually reſts in his own righteouſneſs and in the performance of the duties of the <hi>ſecond Table,</hi> and is either very <hi>negligent</hi> about, or <hi>ſlight</hi> and <hi>perfunctory</hi> in the performance of the duties of the <hi>firſt,</hi> namely the duties that relate to God <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</hi> He would be righteous towards men, but his heart is very far from being truly religious toward God. His chief care is uſually about the outward fairneſs of his converſation, but takes little or no care of purging of his heart of ſecret ſins, or mortifying his inward luſts. And neither is the <hi>glory</hi> of God his <hi>aim,</hi> nor
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:66289:123"/> the word of God his <hi>rule,</hi> but his own credit and eſtimation in the world is chiefly regarded by him. And many times there is ſome ſin or other (though not groſs and notorious) continued in with allowance. And not ſeldom there is a <hi>profeſſed hatred</hi> againſt the practical power of Godlineſs, thinking it more ado than needs. He that has only ſuch a <hi>civility</hi> as this, is not ſufficiently qualified for this holy Table.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He that is <hi>meerly reſtrained</hi> and withholden either by the ſence of his <hi>credit</hi> or fear of <hi>ſhame</hi> or puniſhment from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, but in his heart hankers after it and inclines to it, is not fitly qualified. There are many perſons that have ſome <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints</hi> upon them (as the reſpect they bear to their Parents or Governors or the like) that keep them (for the preſent) from the commiſſion of thoſe ſins which in their hearts they love and would give themſelves over unto if they durſt. And commonly when <hi>thoſe reſtraints</hi> are removed, their <hi>corruptions</hi> break out with more violence. I preſs this no farther, I leave every one herein to deal faithfully and impartially with his own Soul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He that has only an outward formal religiouſneſs is not fitly qualified for this holy Table. I mean ſuch as reſt in the bare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of outward religious duties, and truſt to them for their acceptance with God, not minding nor aiming that their Souls ſhould be <hi>bettered</hi> towards God by their duties. 'Tis a good and uſeful diſtinction (which we have before had occaſion to mention) that of <hi>Religion the end</hi> and <hi>Religion the means.</hi> They that reſt in the <hi>means,</hi> and in outward religious performances, ſuch as pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, receiving the Lords Supper, or the like, without <hi>aiming</hi> at, or <hi>deſigning</hi> that their hearts may be really mended and their lives reformed thereby, (which is the <hi>end</hi> theſe <hi>means</hi> are appointed for) are far from being truly <hi>Religious.</hi> Yet many times ſuch perſons are highly conceited of their <hi>own righteouſneſs,</hi> as the <hi>Phariſee</hi> was, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.9. <hi>Who truſted in himſelf that he was righteous, and deſpiſed others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Such as have only a <hi>ſlight ſorrow</hi> for their ſins paſt, and no ſerious reſolution to amend their lives, nor to forſake what they know to be ſinful and amiſs in themſelves, are by no means fitly qualified for this holy Table.</p>
                  <p>Let every one therefore ſeriouſly examine himſelf, whether he be fitly qualified for this holy ordinance. And there being but only
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:66289:124"/> 
                     <hi>two eſtates</hi> of ſoul toward God that man can be in, <hi>(viz.)</hi> either that <hi>of nature</hi> or that of <hi>grace,</hi> (ſo that every man muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be in the one or the other,) It concerns us to be well acquainted with the <hi>diſtinguiſhing Characters</hi> or <hi>marks</hi> both of the <hi>one</hi> and of the <hi>other,</hi> and to <hi>examine</hi> our ſelves ſeriouſly, that we may know in which of them we are; and to ſtick ſo long upon this work, till we bring it to ſome iſſue, and be able to make a judgment upon our ſelves, to which of them we do indeed belong. In order to the helping us in this great work of <hi>ſelf examination.</hi> I ſhall give the <hi>characters.</hi> 1. Of ſuch as (for the preſent) are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently <hi>unconverted,</hi> and 2. Of ſuch as are <hi>converted.</hi> The <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted</hi> are ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as are groſly ignorant of the main principles of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as are inſenſible of the evil and danger of their ſins, nor have ever had any conſiderable remorſe wrought in their ſouls for them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Such in whoſe hearts <hi>ſin rules and reigns,</hi> ſo that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Such whoſe lives and converſations are wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Such as were never brought to ſee their need of Chriſt in good earneſt nor ſolemnly to accept him for their Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Such as diſreliſh holineſs, and hate the life and power of godlineſs, and malign ſuch as are truly and ſeriouſly religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Such as delight in wicked company, and chuſe ſuch for their companions rather than others.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Such as are groſs neglecters of the means of grace which God hath appointed for the bettering of our ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Such as have long enjoyed the powerful means of grace, but are nothing changed, bettered or reformed thereby.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Such as have the main bent of their hearts ſet upon the pleaſures, profits, and delights of the world; And theſe are the things they chiefly mind, though with the ruining neglect of their Souls. Such perſons for the preſent are apparently uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Let us conſider the marks and characters of ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. The converted are ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are ſuch who by the grace of God have been ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enlightned to ſee the depravation of their natures and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their hearts and lives.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are ſuch as have had their hearts touched and affected with Godly ſorrow, and true remorſe for their ſins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are ſuch as have been brought to ſee their abſolute need of Chriſt, and deliberately and ſolemnly to give up themſelves to him, to be pardoned through the merit of <hi>his active and paſſive obedience,</hi> and to be ſanctified by his ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are ſuch who by the aſſiſtance of grace do labour to mortifie their inward luſts, and to purifie their hearts from ſecret ſins.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are ſuch in whoſe hearts the <hi>intereſt</hi> of God prevailes above the intereſt of the <hi>World</hi> or of the <hi>Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are ſuch who labour to be <hi>holy in all manner of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi> 1. To be religious towards God. 2. Righteous towards men. 3. Sober and temperate in the government of themſelves. 4. Diligent and faithful in the diſcharge of their relative du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They are ſuch as truly love all the people of God, and ſuch as are true members of Chriſts holy Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They are ſuch as labour to be <hi>ſincere</hi> in all that they do.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. They are ſuch as labour to be watchful over themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> over their thoughts, over their affections, over their words, over their actions, and over their aims and ends.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. They are ſuch as in their Judgments do approve the wayes of God as moſt eligible and moſt ſafe.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. They do conſent to, and own the Covenant they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into in their Baptiſm. And theſe are the characters or marks of ſuch as are <hi>Converted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if any one on ſerious examination of himſelf do find that there is any <hi>ſeed</hi> or <hi>principle</hi> of true grace in him, and that it is the ſincere purpoſe of his heart to walk with God, then he ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage himſelf to come to this Ordinance, which was inſtituted to ſtrengthen the <hi>weak Chriſtian.</hi> And ſo much of the <hi>duties which are to be performed before you come to this holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>

                  <p>I come now to ſhew <hi>what are the duties required of you in the time of receiving.</hi> Which are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Carefully avoid <hi>diſtractions,</hi> as much as poſſibly you can, through the whole adminiſtration, <hi>and gird up the loyns of y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. Labour to <hi>quicken</hi> and <hi>excite,</hi> and <hi>awaken</hi> in your ſouls theſe following <hi>graces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Awaken repentance and a bleeding ſorrow in thy heart for all thy ſins paſt, and eſpecially for thoſe that ſit heavieſt upon thy conſcience. Say to thy ſoul in ſome ſuch <hi>ſoliloquies</hi> as theſe; O my ſoul, that ever I ſhould have been ſuch a vile wretch! that I ſhould have ſo grievouſly offended my merciful and bountifull Creator! O what a mercy is it that I am out of Hell!

O my ſoul that this may be <hi>my portion,</hi> whatever God denies me elſe in this world! Oh that this may be a day wherein I may have a clear manifeſtation of Gods <hi>pardoning mercy</hi> made to my Soul! Oh that I may receive a <hi>plentiful effuſion</hi> of the graces of the Spirit into my heart! O that my luſts and corruptions may be mortified and ſubdued! O that I may be enabled to do all my duties <hi>better</hi> than ever I have done! O that I may be more watchful over mine heart and tongue, and all my wayes than ever I have been! O that my ſoul may depart much <hi>bettered,</hi> much <hi>revived, comforted,</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthned,</hi> from this holy Ordinance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Awaken <hi>Faith.</hi> Say to thy ſelf, O my Soul, it is not a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident

                  <p n="4">4. Awaken excite and ſtir up thy heart in love to God and to Jeſus Chriſt. Say to thy ſelf, O my Soul, how great is the love of God in ſending his only Son to dye to ſave poor loſt Sinners? He did not thus for the Angels that fell; O how great is the love of Chriſt who would ſtoop ſo low! That the eternal Son of God ſhould take our nature and be born of a poor Virgin; that he ſhould dye and ſuffer and endure ſo much for poor worms, for enemies; that he ſhould ſweat drops of blood in the Garden in his agony; that he ſhould have his precious body thus broken, and his blood ſhed to redeem us! Was there ever love like this? O my Soul, what hath been done by thee in return for all this love? O my ſweet Jeſus, thou art worthy of all love
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:66289:126"/> and ſervice from me, though mine heart is baſe and diſingenuous, and is not ſufficiently affected with thy love. Thou art infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lovely, though my heart loves thee not as it ought to do. Thou waſt exceeding lovely and amiable even in thine humiliation in this World; but O how glorious art thou now triumphing in heaven? O how beneficial are thy merits? how deſirable are thy graces? O let that fulneſs of grace that is poured forth without meaſure on thee, flow down to us thy poor members. O my Soul imagine now thou ſaweſt thy ſweeteſt Saviour nailed on the Croſs, his body torn with the nails, and his ſide pierced with a Spear. Canſt thou chuſe but love him, who endured ſo much to redeem thee from eternal miſery? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> raviſhed with the love of Chriſt cryes out, <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus, let him be anathema maranatha.</hi> The penitent woman in the Goſpel to whom much was forgiven, loved much, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47. And ſhall it not be ſo with thee? Now conſider O my Soul: Chriſt ſayes <hi>if ye love me keep my commandments;</hi> If thou love him, love him in ſincerity, and delight to pleaſe him. Love his perſon; highly value his merits, love his ordinances, love his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, love his commands. O my Soul, canſt thou upon all theſe conſiderations ſay with <hi>Peter, Lord thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Excite in thy ſelf love to all Chriſtians, to all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt. Pray earneſtly, that the Lord would protect them and defend them, that he would be pleaſed to perfect holineſs more and more in their hearts, and unite them more and more one to another in his truth and in the bond of love, and make them more exemplary in a holy converſation, and ſupply them with all needful outward mercies, and conduct them ſafe to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Excite love in thy Soul to <hi>thy very enemies,</hi> ſay to thy ſelf, O my Soul, thou muſt forgive if thou expecteſt to be forgiven. Thy dear Saviour requires this of thee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.14. <hi>If ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you,</hi> Verſe 15. <hi>But if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes.</hi> If thou expecteſt to be forgiven ſo many <hi>thouſand Talents,</hi> thou muſt not take thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the throat for an <hi>hundred pence, Matth.</hi> 18.28. Thou muſt labour to be <hi>merciful</hi> as thine heavenly Father is merciful.

                     <hi>Readineſs</hi> to forgive injuries and wrongs, is a great ſign of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtate, but <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>revenge</hi> is a black mark and character. Therefore O my Soul, pray for <hi>thy very enemies</hi> this day; Lord convince them of their ſins, give them hearts to repent of them, turn their hearts from them, draw them to thy Son, that by him they may have pardon and life; give them ſuch a frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that thou maiſt bleſs them. O that I may meet their ſouls in Heaven, where we ſhall always love, and agree together, and never fall out more.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Awake and excite in thy ſelf <hi>ſpiritual joy and thankfulneſs.</hi> Say with holy <hi>David, bleſs the Lord O my Soul, and forget not all his benefits.</hi> Hath Chriſt redeemed thee from the <hi>curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for thee?</hi> Hath he redeemed thee, and that <hi>not with ſilver and gold,</hi> but with his <hi>own precious blood?</hi> Hath he made thy peace with God <hi>through the blood of his Croſs?</hi> Hath he vanquiſhed death and Satan for thee? Through his blood ſhalt thou have an entrance into heaven and eternal glory? Oh tranſcendent mercy! Oh how great is this Salvation which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us! On the <hi>heighth and depth and length and breadth of the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus!</hi> Be aſtoniſhed Oh my Soul at this love, and never be forgetful of it; call upon the holy Angels to joyn with thee this day in bleſſing God for theſe great and glorious benefits, and never be unmindful of ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent mercies. And thus much of the <hi>graces</hi> we muſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially labour to <hi>excite</hi> and <hi>exerciſe</hi> in the time of Receiving. There are ſome other directions alſo that it will be needful thou ſhouldſt obſerve at this time.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Employ thine <hi>outward ſenſes</hi> ſo, as to ſtir up in thine heart <hi>Spiritual graces.</hi> For the work of the Communicant lyes not ſo much between the <hi>body</hi> and the <hi>elements</hi> as the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When thou ſeeſt the bread broken, think of theſe four things. 1. The great pain and anguiſh our Lord endured when his Body was broken on the Croſs. Canſt thou ſee Chriſts body broken for thee, and thy heart not break with deep contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for thy ſins? 2. Conſider the great love of our Lord in ſubmitting to ſuch grievous pains, and ſuch diſgrace for our ſake. Think thou heareſt him ſay, <hi>behold my friends, how my fleſh is torn and wounded for your ſakes.</hi> Was there ever grief,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:66289:127"/> was there ever love like mine? 3. Conſider the vile and odious nature of ſin which brought our Lord to ſuch miſeries and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſuch blood to expiate it. 4. Conſider what the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every Soul (that ſhall be ſaved) did coſt. It coſt more than all the men and Angels in the World could ever have paid for it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When thou takeſt the bread into thine hands and eateſt of it, then ſay, <hi>Lord thou art the bread of life, thou art the only redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of loſt Souls.</hi> I freely take thee for <hi>my Lord and Saviour,</hi> I freely conſent to the Covenant I was entred into in my Baptiſm. Lord ſave me and ſanctify me, O interpoſe thy merits this day for my <hi>pardon,</hi> and ſtrengthen me by thy grace, that I may be faithful to thee to the end, and ſo may at laſt receive a crown of life. Lord behold the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of thy Son. For the ſake of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſufferings be pleaſed to be reconciled to me; to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all my tranſgreſſions, and by thy grace ſo to ſanctify mine heart, that no ſin may have <hi>dominion over me.</hi> Fill me with <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> in believing. If I have found favour in thine eyes, give me more and more of the graces of thy holy Spirit, and cauſe me to <hi>grow in grace</hi> daily, and make me fruitful in good works.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When thou takeſt the <hi>cup</hi> into thy hand, think again of the wonderful love of Chriſt, that he ſhould purchaſe us to himſelf with his own blood. Oh the infinite value, O the infinite worth of this blood! This was the <hi>blood</hi> that <hi>only</hi> could make expiation and give God ful ſatisfaction for our offences. One drop of this blood is worth a World. This is the blood of <hi>the everlaſting Covenant, Heb.</hi> 13.20. that is, whereby our Saviour <hi>ratified</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> the covenant which God made with fallen man; which covenant ſhall never be altered. O bleſſed Saviour waſh my Soul in this thy precious blood from the guilt of all my ſins, and cleanſe me from all mine iniquities, and be to me <hi>all that</hi> which thou didſt intend to be to thoſe who ſhall be ſaved by thee. By ſuch <hi>prayers, ſoliloquies</hi> and holy <hi>meditations</hi> thou ſhould'ſt labour to <hi>Sanctifie</hi> thy heart, when thou art about receiving this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Joyn with all the reſt of the Communicants in a hearty prayſing God for all theſe glorious favours and benefits. Let thy Soul rejoyce in God and call upon all within thee to praiſe his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name.</p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:66289:127"/>
                  <p n="6">6. Pray earneſtly that Chriſts Kingdom may be propagated, and that many others may come to underſtand and partake of this great ſalvation, purchaſed by our Lord and Saviour. Pray that he may be <hi>more known, believed on</hi> and <hi>faithfully obeyed all the world</hi> over.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſo much of the duties to be performed in time of receiving.</hi> I come now to <hi>thoſe required of thee after thou haſt received.</hi> For it is not enough that thou duly prepare thy ſelf for this ordinance, and carry thy ſelf <hi>reverently</hi> at it, but thou muſt labour to walk ſuitably unto it afterwards. To that end obſerve theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When the Ordinance is done withdraw thy ſelf to ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret place, and there on thy knees bleſs the Lord for Jeſus Chriſt, and for the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> made in him, and for adding the <hi>Sacraments as Seals of the Covenant</hi> to confirm thy faith. And further, for giving thee to be born in a land, where the glorious light of the Goſpel has ſhone ſo clearly for ſo many years, and where thou haſt ſuch great helps and advantages for the eternal good of thy Soul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Labour to keep thy heart in the fervent love of God and Jeſus Chriſt; and with an holy delight and joy meditate often how much thou oweſt to God for ſending his Son to be thy redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and how much thou oweſt to Chriſt for ſo willingly conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to undertake this great work. The Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. that to them that believe in him he is precious, yea very precious in many reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His <hi>name</hi> is precious. 'Tis as an ointment poured forth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. His name ſhall be called <hi>Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> And 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. <hi>laſt.</hi> 'Tis Jeſus <hi>who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth us from the wrath to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. His <hi>perſon</hi> is precious, being God and Man in the ſame perſon. What an high honour is it to be related to him?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His <hi>Offices</hi> are precious. He is <hi>Prophet, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>King;</hi> and he took on him all theſe offices for our benefit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. His <hi>performances</hi> are precious, both his <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. His <hi>Life</hi> is precious, which was ſo <hi>holy,</hi> ſo <hi>humble,</hi> ſo <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. His <hi>Death</hi> is precious, being a propitiatory Sacrifice for our ſins.</p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:66289:128"/>
                  <p n="7">7. His <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is precious. For God releaſing him from the priſon of the grave, thereby declared, he had received full ſatisfaction for the debt of our ſins, which he as our <hi>Surety</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to diſcharge.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. His <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> is precious. For he aſcended into Heaven as our <hi>fore-runner,</hi> to prepare a place for us.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. His <hi>Interceſſion</hi> is precious. For he ever liveth to make <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion</hi> for us.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. His <hi>authority and power</hi> is precious, whereby he governs his Church, and which he will farther exerciſe in <hi>raiſing our bodies from the Grave,</hi> and in <hi>Judging the World</hi> at the laſt day and making our bodies (if we be his members) like his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. His <hi>Doctrince</hi> is precious.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. His <hi>Ordinances</hi> are precious.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. His <hi>

                        </gap>ntereſt</hi> is precious to all that truly believe in him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Meditate on the <hi>priviledges, promiſes, and comforts</hi> of the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> ſealed by the blood of thy dear Savior. The <hi>priviledges are Juſtification, Sanctification, Adoption, Glorification.</hi> O how great are theſe priviledges! The <hi>promiſes</hi> are ſuch as theſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>The Lord is a Sun and ſhield, the Lord will give grace and glory; no good thing will he withold from them that walk uprightly.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things ſhall work together for good to them that love God.</hi> The <hi>comforts</hi> are the <hi>conſolations of the Spirit</hi> here, and <hi>eternal comfort</hi> hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Earneſtly beg and humbly expect grace from Chriſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thee to crucifie thy inward luſts and corruptions, eſpecially thoſe thou findeſt thy heart moſt peſtered with. Having enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Chriſt into thy Soul, do not <hi>unhallow</hi> it again, by ſuffering any evil luſt to reign and rule therein.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Labour to walk more watchfully. Remember, the Devil will now be very buſie to tempt thee to ſin after this ordinance, as he did our Saviour preſently after his <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> He will, if he can, by ſome worldly diverſion damp and cool thoſe heavenly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that were excited in thee in time of receiving. 'Tis a dangerous thing after an heat and warmth of heavenly affections to catch cold.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Labour to ſtrengthen thy purpoſes and reſolutions of living more unto God.</p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:66289:128"/>
                  <p>Remember thou haſt ſtronger obligations now upon thee to all Chriſtian duties than before.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Often meditate on the <hi>joys</hi> of Heaven and the <hi>eternal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> of the Lamb, and the bleſſed life which the Saints do live above, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.15. <hi>Bleſſed is he that ſhall eat bread in the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Labour to live in charity with thy brethren, to which thou art in an eſpecial manner engaged by this Sacrament. Do not cover the <hi>coals of contention</hi> under the <hi>aſhes</hi> for a night or two, and then <hi>blow</hi> them up again. But conſider, if Chriſt hath ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thee, and forgiven thee ſo much, thou oughteſt to love thine enemies and heartily forgive them. Remember what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Beloved if Chriſt ſo loved us, we ought to love one another.</hi> 1 John 4.11.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly. When thou art tempted to ſin, remember thou haſt been at a Sacrament, and there haſt renewed thy Covenant with Chriſt; and thou muſt not be ſo baſe, nor ſo falſe as willingly and deliberately to ſin againſt him again. And thus much of the duties to be performed before we come to receive, and in the time of receiving, and after we have received.</p>

                  <head>A Brief Expoſition OF THE Lords Prayer.</head>
                  <p>OUR Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> taught his Diſciples <hi>after what manner to Pray,</hi> and gave them a <hi>breviary</hi> or <hi>pattern</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which they might uſe <hi>in form</hi> (as ſeems to be intimated, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.2.) or <hi>according to which</hi> they might order and regulate their other Prayers.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>Plat-form</hi> there are <hi>three</hi> parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Preface,</hi> Deſcribing God, to whom we are to pray. (1.) By his <hi>dear Relation</hi> to us; <hi>[Our Father,]</hi> therefore moſt ready to ſuccour <hi>us</hi> and <hi>others, with whom</hi> or <hi>for whom</hi> we pray. (2.) By his <hi>greatneſs</hi> and <hi>Majeſty, [which art in Heaven;]</hi> that is, who doth manifeſt himſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſubſtance of the Prayer</hi> containing <hi>ſix Petitions.</hi> The <hi>three firſt</hi> whereof have reſpect to <hi>Gods Glory; the three latter</hi> to our ſelves and our particular good.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>[Hallowed be thy Name;]</hi> wherein we Pray and Petition that Gods <hi>glorious Nature</hi> and <hi>Attributes, viz.</hi> his <hi>infinite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb facs="tcp:66289:130"/> Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Juſtice, Truth, Mercy. &amp;c.</hi> (which are diſcovered in his <hi>word</hi> and <hi>works</hi> and whereby he is <hi>made known</hi> as men are by their <hi>names</hi>) may be diſplayed and more manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world, that all men may acknowledge and own him for the <hi>only true God,</hi> and may glorify him accordingly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>[Thy Kingdom come;]</hi> that is, that his <hi>Kingly Power</hi> may be more and more manifeſted in the curbing and ſubduing of <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>all his enemies,</hi> that his Kingdom of Grace may be advanced and promoted by his word and Spirit; that his <hi>Kingdom of Glory</hi> may be haſtned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.20. that the happineſs of his people may be full, and that Chriſt may reſign up the Kingdom which he adminiſters as <hi>Mediator</hi> to his <hi>Father,</hi> and God may be <hi>all</hi> in <hi>all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>[Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven;]</hi> that is, that <hi>we</hi> and <hi>all his people on Earth</hi> may <hi>ſincerely, chearfully</hi> and <hi>conſtantly</hi> do and <hi>ſubmit</hi> to his holy will, as <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>glorified Saints</hi> do in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>[Give us this day our daily-bread;]</hi> wherein we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Giver of all our Mercies,</hi> and that we receive all from his free bounty: That we ought dayly to depend on his <hi>Fatherly care</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> and not to be <hi>over anxious</hi> and <hi>ſolicitous for to morrow,</hi> neither inordinately to deſire <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities,</hi> but to crave and pray for ſuch neceſſary and convenient things as are daily needful and requiſite for the ſuſtentation and comfort of our bodily life, and that what the Lord is pleaſed to give us may be by him bleſſed to us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>[And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors;]</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we acknowledg that our ſins are debts, binding us over to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and that our ſelves cannot ſatisfie for them. We pray that in Chriſt theſe debts may be freely and fully forgiven and pardoned. We profeſs we ought and do (through his grace aſſiſting us) forgive our debtors (that is, ſuch as have done wrong to us, and thereby not only made themſelves debtors to God but unto us;) that we do fully and freely forgive their wrongs and injuries done unto us, (though we are not alwayes
<pb facs="tcp:66289:130"/> bound to forgive the damage, See <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.1, 14.) and from thence we gather an argument to confirm our hope and perſwade our ſelves that God will forgive us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>[And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil;]</hi> wherein we acknowledge our proneneſs to evil, and weakneſs to withſtand temptation; that God hath power over all <hi>corruptions tempters</hi> and <hi>temptations.</hi> We pray to be preſerved from temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſin or from being overcome by them, and at laſt to be wholly delivered from them all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Concluſion, [For thine is the Kingdom the Power and Glory for ever, Amen.]</hi> Wherein we have (1.) The <hi>Doxology,</hi> acknowledging and aſcribing to God, the perpetuity of his <hi>Kingdom, Power</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and encouraging our ſelves from thence to expect from him what we have prayed for. (2.) The <hi>ſealing</hi> up the Prayer with <hi>Amen.</hi> Wherein we ſummarily teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy our <hi>fervent deſire</hi> of obtaining theſe our Petitions and our Faith in God for the granting of them.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Having ſhewed what an <hi>Oath</hi> is, I come in the next place to prove the <hi>lawfulneſs of taking an Oath</hi> when duly called thereunto. And this I ſhall indeavor to do by theſe four <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1.

But to <hi>Swear by</hi> God when duly called thereunto, is a <hi>moral duy,</hi> and injoyned in the <hi>third Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> therefore it is <hi>lawful to take an oath</hi> when duly called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. The <hi>minor</hi> will eaſily be proved by that <hi>commonly received Rule</hi> of interpreting the Commandments, <hi>viz.</hi> that where in any Commandment <hi>vice</hi> is forbidden, there the <hi>contrary vertue</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned and commanded. So that the <hi>taking Gods name in vain being forbidden</hi> in the third Commandment, the <hi>holy and reverent uſe thereof is plainly enjoyned,</hi> and ſuch is an <hi>appeal to God</hi> as the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:66289:132"/> 
                  <hi>Searcher of hearts,</hi> and calling upon him to be a <hi>witneſs</hi> of our truth and ſincerity, and an <hi>avenger</hi> upon us in caſe of falſhood.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What God injoyns and connects with other duties that will ever be in force, ought to be practiſed by all Chriſtians; but <hi>ſwearing by his name</hi> is <hi>ſuch;</hi> Ergò. For the proof of the <hi>minor</hi> See <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, and ſerve him</hi> and <hi>ſwear by his name.</hi> See alſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.20. where the ſame thing is injoyned. That which hath been the practice of the Godly without reproof, <hi>before</hi> the Law, <hi>under</hi> the Law and <hi>under the Goſpel,</hi> is lawful; But <hi>ſwearing by the name of God,</hi> upon ſerious and weighty occaſions, hath been the practice of all the Godly in all thoſe times; Ergò.</p>

               <p>The words of thoſe two Texts are theſe.</p>
               <p>Matth. 5. <hi>verſe</hi> 33. <hi>Again ye have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf, but ſhalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto the Lord thine Oaths.</hi> verſe 34. <hi>but I ſay unto you, ſwear not all, neither by Heaven, for it is Gods throne,</hi> verſe 35. <hi>nor by the Earth, for it is his footſtool; neither by Jeruſalem, for it is the City of the great King.</hi> verſe 36. <hi>neither ſhalt thou ſwear by thy head, becauſe thou canſt not make one hair white or black,</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:66289:133"/> verſe. 37. <hi>but let your communication be yea yea, nay nay, for whatſoever is more than theſe cometh of evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>James 5.12. <hi>But above all things, my brethren, ſwear not, neither by Heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath; but let your yea be yea, and your nay nay, leſt ye fall into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the clearer underſtanding of theſe two Scriptures theſe <hi>two things</hi> muſt be premiſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt take notice of that <hi>rule,</hi> which is to be obſerved in the ſound interpretation of any Text that is difficult, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>no one Scripture ought to have any other ſenſe put upon it than what will fairly agree with other Scriptures, and firmly ſtand with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt have a <hi>ſpecial regard</hi> to the <hi>condition</hi> and <hi>manners</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> at this time, when theſe precepts were given. The Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> (as it ſeems) were now commonly guilty of theſe three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of <hi>frequent, familiar</hi> and <hi>cuſtomary</hi> ſwearing in their <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary communication,</hi> which they made light of, provided they did not ſwear falſly, or forſwear themſelves.</item>
                  <item>2. They uſed much to ſwear by the <hi>creatures.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. They made a great difference of Oaths made by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, eſteeming ſome of them to be binding and others not.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now the words of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle James</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to be directed againſt theſe enormities.</p>
               <p>Which things being <hi>premiſed.</hi> I come to conſider the words themſelves.</p>
               <p>Matth. 5. verſe 33. <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf, but ſhalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto the Lord thine Oaths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Saviour having before ſhewed the corrupt <hi>gloſſes</hi> and <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations</hi> which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> made on the ſixth and ſeventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, he comes here to ſhew how they did the like on the third alſo. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> (it ſeems) taught, that if men did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear themſelves, they did fulfill the third Commandment, though they did ſwear <hi>familiarly</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> in their ordinary communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſometimes by the <hi>Creatures.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. I come now to ſhew in what manner an Oath is to be taken. The Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> inſtructs us fully as to this, Chap. 4.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Lord li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> in <hi>truth,</hi> in <hi>judgement,</hi> and in <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>truth.</hi> That is, <hi>truly,</hi> ſwearing nothing but the truth, and not abuſing the <hi>dreadful name</hi> of God to atteſt a falſhood. <hi>Zech.</hi> 5.4. God ſeverely threatens him <hi>that ſweareth falſly by his name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>judgment,</hi> that is, <hi>conſiderately,</hi> well weighing what thou art to ſwear, and by <hi>whom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> binding thy ſelf to nothing but what is in it ſelf <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>right,</hi> and having a full purpoſe to perform what thou by oath bindeſt thy ſelf to, and being careful to make it good accordingly.</p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>forms</hi> of ſwearing, I find theſe mentioned in the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Lifting up the hand to the moſt high God.</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> ſwore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22. <hi>And Abraham ſaid to the King of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the moſt h gh God, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:66289:136" rendition="simple:additions"/> And thus the <hi>Angel</hi> ſwore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.5. <hi>And the Angel which I ſaw ſtand upon the Sea, and upon the Earth, lifted up his hand to Heaven, and ſware by him that liveth for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Putting the hand under the thigh.</hi> Thus <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant ſwore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.2. And <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid unto his eldeſt ſervant of his houſe, that ruled over all that he had, <hi>Put,</hi> I pray thee, <hi>thy hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my thigh. And I will make thee ſwear by the Lord God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the God of the earth, that thou ſhalt not take a wife for my Son of the daughters of the Canaanites.</hi> And thus <hi>Jacob</hi> cauſed <hi>Joſeph</hi> to ſwear, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.29, 30, 31. <hi>If now I have found grace in thy ſight,</hi> put, <hi>I pray thee,</hi> thy hand under my thigh and <hi>ſwear unto me: And he ſware unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our rite of ſwearing for the <hi>Commons of England</hi> is by <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the hand on the book of the Goſpels,</hi> and kiſſing it, which is to be underſtood (as I ſuppoſe) only to ſignifie our <hi>believing in God,</hi> and expecting help from him through Chriſt, according to the Goſpel, as we ſpeak the truth. Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> lib. 2. <hi>Med.</hi> c. 10. ſayes, that ſolemnity which in ſome places is uſed, of touching and kiſſing the book, is plainly of the ſame kind and import with the elevation of the hand; that is, it ſignifies a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſwear, and to the oath it ſelf.<note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Solomons</hi> time when they took an Oath, they <hi>touched the Altar,</hi> which Ceremony was alſo uſed among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Whereby was ſignified that they called <hi>him to witneſs</hi> who was worſhipped with Sacrifices offered upon thoſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But if any ſcruple this rite and form of ſwearing and had rather uſe that other of lifting up the hand to the moſt high, I ſee no reaſon (if it may ſtand with the laws of the Land) but that they may be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged therein; this form of ſwearing being every way as binding as the other.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I come now in the next place to ſhew the <hi>great evil,</hi> and <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> of <hi>raſh, cuſtomary</hi> and <hi>unneceſſary ſwearing.</hi> This is a ſin very riſe and common in our Nation, and one of thoſe for which the <hi>Land mourns.</hi> I ſhall therefore preſent ſeveral <hi>arguments</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations</hi> which may ſufficiently demonſtrate the heinouſneſs of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider how <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Venerable</hi> the <hi>name</hi> of our great God ought alwayes to be unto us. Every <hi>thought</hi> and <hi>mention</hi> of it ſhould be accompanied with reverence. 'Tis a duty ſtrictly injoyned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.58. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the glorious and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:66289:136"/> name of the Lord thy God.</hi> How great a ſin then is it to <hi>vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, prophane,</hi> and <hi>make it common?</hi> How high a provocation muſt it needs be to the <hi>Almighty</hi> for poor mortals familiarly to toſs his <hi>dreadful name</hi> in their mouths upon every ſlight occaſion, and to make it the ordinary <hi>expletive</hi> or <hi>filling up</hi> of their ſpeech and language. Surely ſome of the more <hi>civilized Heathens</hi> were of better minds, and uſed the names of <hi>their gods</hi> with more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. But O the impiety of our times! How prophanely and irreverently do ſome (who call themſelves Chriſtians) uſe the name of the great God whom the <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven continually delight to laud and praiſe, crying, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Heaven, the whole earth is full of his glory,</hi> Iſa. 6.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider that the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>third Commandments</hi> of all the reſt, have ſeveral <hi>threatnings</hi> annexed to them, to ſhew us how greatly God is provoked by <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>taking his name in vain.</hi> He threatens he will not hold ſuch guiltleſs; that is, he will be ſo far from abſolving or acquitting ſuch tranſgreſſors that he will grievouſly puniſh them, and they ſhall not eſcape his juſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider our tongues ſhould be our Glory. The proper end for which God hath given us the uſe of ſpeech is to glorify and honour him <hi>our Creator,</hi> and to profit one another. Our words therefore ſhould be <hi>good, ſound,</hi> and <hi>ſavoury; Let no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt communication</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.29.) <hi>Proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the uſe of edifying, that it may miniſter grace to the hearers.</hi> And our Saviour tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. that of <hi>every idle word</hi> (which is <hi>frivolous</hi> and <hi>fruitleſs) we ſhall give an account in the day of Judgment.</hi> And therefore a much more ſevere account ſurely men ſhall give of their wicked <hi>ſwearing, blaſpheming,</hi> and <hi>curſing,</hi> which are no proper works for them to imploy their tongues in, but a horrible <hi>depraving, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi> and <hi>defiling</hi> of ſo excellent a member.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider what a <hi>high pitch</hi> of wickedneſs it is for any to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave ſuch an holy inſtitution as an <hi>Oath</hi> is, (which ſhould always be uſed <hi>reverently</hi> and only upon great and ſerious occaſions) and to <hi>proſtitute</hi> it to the venting of every baſe paſſion, and uttering of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Preſumption</hi> and fearleſneſs of God, and to make that which ſhould be a <hi>tremendous Ordinance</hi> to us, a <hi>common, ſlight,</hi> and familiar thing.</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:66289:137"/>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider how <hi>diſhonourable</hi> it is to our Chriſtian profeſſion that thoſe that call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould live in ſuch a flat contradiction to the Laws of Chriſt, and ſhould make nothing of <hi>familiar</hi> and <hi>cuſtomary</hi> ſwearing, which he ſo <hi>ſeverely prohibits</hi> Matth. 5.33. <hi>James</hi> 5.12. Is not this one of the ſins for which the name of our Lord Jeſus is blaſphemed among <hi>Turks, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider this is one of <hi>thoſe ſins</hi> for which God hath a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with a Nation,</hi> and which haſtens down Judgment upon it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Hear the word of the Lord ye children of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>For the Lord hath a controverſie with the inhabitants of the Land, becauſe there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the Land. By ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</hi> Jer. 23.10. <hi>Becauſe of ſwearing the Land mourneth,</hi> ſee alſo <hi>Zech.</hi> 5 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Amos</hi> 8.14. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.4, 5.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Conſider how highly this ſin is <hi>aggravated</hi> and the guilt of it <hi>inhaunced</hi> in that there is ſo little <hi>temptation</hi> to it. Other ſins have an <hi>external</hi> bait and <hi>motive,</hi> either <hi>pleaſure, profit,</hi> or <hi>credit,</hi> but in <hi>ſwearing</hi> and <hi>curſing</hi> there is none of theſe. O the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of this ſin! What ſence is gratified by it? or what is there to incite or move a man to it but meerly <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of ſpirit, preſumtion</hi> and <hi>fearleſneſs</hi> of the Almighty? Now the leſs temptation there is to any ſin, the greater is the contempt of God in the committing of it. This ſin is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much worſe than <hi>Epicuriſm;</hi>

And tell me (I pray you) whether you would not think <hi>that Dog</hi> to be mad that you ſaw flye in his Maſters face that kept him? and are you then any thing ſhort of <hi>mad men</hi> that dare thus <hi>impudently,</hi> and <hi>daringly</hi> defie your Creator?

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Having now done with the <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Reaſons</hi> which ſufficiently demonſtrate the heinouſneſs of this ſin, I come in the next place to anſwer theſe <hi>vain pretences</hi> and <hi>excuſes</hi> which <hi>cuſtomary ſwearers</hi> uſe to make for themſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are apt to plead that <hi>they have been long uſed to it,</hi> and have got a habit and cuſtom of it, which now they cannot eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave. To which I anſwer that this is a very irrational plea. For he that is an <hi>habitual ſinner</hi> is far more <hi>abominable</hi> in the ſight of God than he that ſins only upon a particular temptation or provocation. Would any man think this a <hi>good plea</hi> for a <hi>Thief</hi> to make at the Bar; My Lord, I have been ſo long uſed to <hi>thieving</hi> and <hi>ſtealing</hi> even from my youth, and am now ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to it, that I cannot leave it. Is not this a <hi>ſtrong reaſon</hi> why he ſhould not be ſpared, but the more ſpeedily ſent to the Gallows? And moreover the truth is, <hi>this is a very vain pretence.</hi> For thoſe that have been long accuſtomed to ſwearing can and do ordinarily forbear it, when they are in the preſence of <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>ſerious</hi> perſons, whom they do reverence and reſpect. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident I am, were it made <hi>High Treaſon</hi> againſt the <hi>King,</hi> as it is againſt the <hi>King of Heaven,</hi> profanely and cuſtomarily to ſwear and curſe, it would be left and forborn. For the will hath a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotick and commanding power</hi> over the tongue as well as other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body, and can reſtrain it if it pleaſe; and therefore it is a very <hi>vain excuſe</hi> for any to ſay they cannot leave it.</p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:66289:139"/>
               <p n="2">2. Some will ſay, they had not <hi>ſworn</hi> if they had not been <hi>provoked</hi> to it. For anſwer to that, let ſuch perſons conſider, that the <hi>provocations</hi> they ſpeak of would be ineffectual and not <hi>prevail</hi> upon them, if their <hi>hearts</hi> were not very corrupt; For how many <hi>good</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> perſons meet with <hi>great,</hi> and perhaps greater <hi>provocations</hi> than theſe men meet with, who yet are never provoked to <hi>ſwear</hi> or <hi>curſe</hi> or do any thing like unto it. If therefore there were not a <hi>naughty heart</hi> within, accuſtomed to ſin, the outward <hi>temptation</hi> would not ſo prevail.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some will plead, they ſhall not be <hi>believed</hi> except they <hi>ſwear.</hi> To which I anſwer, no wiſe man will believe a man the more, but rather the leſs for his <hi>ſwearing.</hi> For he that makes not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of one ſin, in all likelihood will not of another, when he ſees it is for his <hi>outward advantage</hi> to commit it. There is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think that man will ſtick to lye who ſticks not to ſwear: And if ſuch perſons who do uſually ſwear, do indeed believe in God, why do they not obey him, who forbids them to ſwear. if they do not, why ſhould we believe them, when they ſwear by God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some <hi>ſwearers</hi> will ſay, they mean no harm by it. For anſwer to that, let them conſider whether any <hi>Prince</hi> in the World will allow a Subject of his to uſe his tongue as he pleaſes, to his diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and put it up, becauſe the man ſayes he means no harm by it. Much leſs will the King of Heaven bear with their audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous profaning of his <hi>name</hi> upon pretence that thou intendeſt no harm. Such as a mans <hi>tongue</hi> is, ſuch is the man. For as our Saviour ſaith. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.34, 35. <hi>An evil man out of the evil treaſure of his heart bringeth forth evil things, and a good man out of the good treaſure of his heart bringeth forth good things: for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Some will ſay they ſwear but <hi>ſmall oaths, viz.</hi> By the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary</hi> or (as we uſually abbreviate it) yes <hi>Marry;</hi> or by <hi>their head,</hi> or by the <hi>ligh, &amp;c.</hi> To which I anſwer, that we are not to think any ſin <hi>ſmall</hi> which we willingly commit, ſeeing the wages of the leaſt ſin is death. And further, we are to conſider that <hi>ſwearing</hi> (when duly called to it) is an act of <hi>worſhip</hi> which we ow to God, and we ought to ſwear <hi>by his name only;</hi> and that only in <hi>weighty caſes</hi> as we have ſhewed before, from <hi>Deut.</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:66289:139"/> 6.13. And therefore the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſharply reproves thoſe who <hi>ſwear</hi> by the <hi>ſin</hi> (meaning the <hi>Idol) of Samaria,</hi> Amos 8.14. And that is a <hi>terrible place,</hi> Jer. 5.7. where God ſayes. <hi>How ſhall I pardon them for this? their Children have forſaken me, and ſworn by them that are no gods.</hi> Remember therefore, that when you ſwear by the <hi>creatures,</hi> you are guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating that to a <hi>creature</hi> which belongs to God only, viz. <hi>omniſcience, omnipreſence, &amp;c.</hi> And if you ſwear by the <hi>name</hi> of God <hi>ordinarily,</hi> by making it common you <hi>pollute</hi> and <hi>profane it,</hi> contrary to Gods expreſs command, <hi>Levit.</hi> 22.32. <hi>You ſhall not pollute my holy name, but I will be hallowed among the Children of Iſrael.</hi> And ſo much by way of anſwer to the vain <hi>excuſes</hi> of cuſtomary ſwearers.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I come now in the <hi>laſt place</hi> to give ſome <hi>directions</hi> and <hi>means</hi> for the avoiding of this ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed of <hi>inordinate anger,</hi> and <hi>impatience</hi> which uſually <hi>hurries</hi> people into a <hi>regardleſneſs</hi> of the duty they owe to God, and tranſports them into a kind of <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>phrenſie,</hi> that they ſcarce know what they ſay.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed of <hi>pride,</hi> and a <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>fooliſh affectation</hi> to be approved and applauded by wicked men. There are ſome who take a pride in <hi>ſwearing,</hi> and think it a piece of bravery and gallantry to rap out damnable oaths. But there is no man of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>or</hi> religion, that will not think them fools for ſo doing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take heed of <hi>greedy covetouſneſs.</hi> For many men ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of an inordinate deſire of <hi>lucre</hi> and <hi>gain</hi> in their ordinary dealing, to countenance a <hi>profitable Lye,</hi> will add an oath to it. They will exceſſively commend the <hi>goods</hi> and <hi>commodities</hi> they are to ſell, and if they find people difficult to believe them, they will not ſtick to ſwear to it, when many times they <hi>know,</hi> and poſſibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards will bragg how they cheated their neighbour. 'Tis true, there are ſome who will not <hi>ſwear,</hi> yet will <hi>lye;</hi> but there are but few of thoſe who uſually <hi>ſwear,</hi> that make any conſcience of lying.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Take heed of <hi>earneſt aſſeverations,</hi> and <hi>proteſtations</hi> ſuch as theſe, <hi>as I hope to be ſaved; As I live,</hi> which ſome hold to be a <hi>formal Oath,</hi> and the <hi>Oath</hi> that God himſelf ſwears by, <hi>As I am a Chriſtian; I proteſt before God;</hi> (which if ſeriouſly uttered, I make no queſtion but is an Oath) <hi>I vow to God, &amp;c.</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:66289:140"/> what our Saviour ſayes, <hi>let your commuication be yea, yea, nay, nay, for what is more then this cometh of the evil one.</hi> Take heed alſo of ſuch <hi>forms</hi> of words as many uſe, as <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>troth,</hi> which are I ſuppoſe the <hi>abbreviations</hi> of <hi>by my faith,</hi> and <hi>by my truth.</hi> For an upright and ſincere Chriſtian ſhould abſtain from thoſe things that are <hi>male-colorata</hi> (as one ſayes) which have a <hi>great ſhew</hi> and appearance of evil in them, as <hi>ſuch words as theſe</hi> (ſo uſed) have, and which miniſter occaſion of ſcandal and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to very <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> perſons.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Shun the <hi>company</hi> as much as poſſibly you can, of <hi>cuſtomary ſwearers,</hi> becauſe our corrupt <hi>nature</hi> is eaſily infected. As <hi>civil men</hi> living among <hi>barbarous people,</hi> quickly loſe the <hi>purity</hi> of their own <hi>language,</hi> and have their <hi>ſpeech corrupted</hi> with the <hi>barbariſms</hi> that are daily ſounding in their ears; ſo they that live among <hi>conſtant ſwearers,</hi> are very apt (if they be not very watchful) to be infected with this <hi>vice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Meditate often on the <hi>dreadful judgments</hi> which God hath threatned againſt <hi>ſuch ſinners, Zech.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Every one that ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſhall be cut off, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.58, 59. God threatens that thoſe that do not <hi>fear his glorious and dreadful name,</hi> he <hi>will make their plagues wonderful.</hi> Cuſtomary <hi>ſwearing</hi> brands the <hi>ſwearer</hi> with the <hi>black mark</hi> of a profane perſon, and expoſes him to the wrath and curſe of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When thou art called to take an <hi>Oath</hi> whether <hi>aſsertory</hi> or <hi>promiſſory,</hi> go about it with that <hi>deliberation, ſeriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> which is ſuitable to the <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> whom thou calleſt to <hi>witneſs.</hi> Upon an <hi>Oath</hi> credit is given, becauſe a man can go no <hi>higher</hi> than to <hi>appeal unto God;</hi> and 'tis ſuppoſed, that no man that underſtands himſelf, would <hi>knowingly</hi> and <hi>willingly</hi> draw down the wrath and diſpleaſure of God upon himſelf. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome of the more civilized <hi>Heathens</hi> abhorred the ſin of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. One</hi> of them being importuned by his friends to take a <hi>falſe Oath</hi> for his advantage, told him, he would be his friend <hi>uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ad aras</hi> and no further; meaning that no friendſhip ſhould make him <hi>ſwear a falſe Oath</hi> upon the Altar for him. And if <hi>Heathens</hi> have been ſo conſcious, how much more ſhould thoſe that call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians</hi> take heed of offending in this kind? And therefore in <hi>aſſertory Oaths</hi> they ſhould affirm nothing but either <hi>as they know, or as they believe,</hi> and that <hi>plainly</hi> without
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:66289:140"/> 
                  <hi>equivocation</hi> or <hi>mental reſervation,</hi> which fruſtrate the very <hi>end</hi> of an Oath, which is to give <hi>ſatisfaction in a doubtful matter;</hi> And who would reſt ſatisfied with anothers <hi>Oath,</hi> if he knew it were not to be underſtood according to the uſual <hi>ſignification of the words,</hi> but according to the <hi>ſecret meaning</hi> of the <hi>ſwearer,</hi> which is to him <hi>unknown?</hi> So likewiſe in <hi>promiſſory</hi> Oaths, they ſhould be <hi>careful</hi> not to oblige themſelves to <hi>any thing</hi> but what is <hi>juſt</hi> and fit to be done, and within their power to perform; and they ſhould conſider likewiſe what is <hi>the true and main intent</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of <hi>that</hi> they engage themſelves to, and accordingly endeavour faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to perform it. <hi>For ratio legis</hi> eſt <hi>anima legis</hi> &amp; <hi>ratio ſtatute</hi> eſt <hi>ſtatutum,</hi> as the learned ſpeak.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Pray to God earneſtly to plant <hi>his fear in thy heart,</hi> and then thou wilt fear <hi>offending</hi> againſt him in this or any other kind. And keep a conſtant <hi>watch over thy tongue,</hi> and take heed of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that <hi>member,</hi> which in many <hi>careleſs Chriſtians</hi> is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of much ſin and evil. <hi>A Righteous man feareth an Oath.</hi> Eccleſ. 9.2.</p>

               <p n="4">4. I come now to give ſome remedies, and directions againſt it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Seeing people are ſo prone to this vice (through natural corruption,) let all <hi>humble</hi> themſelves before God for every ſin of this nature that ever they have been guilty of, in any part of their lives. <hi>Sins</hi> that we truly repent of, we are careful to keep our ſelves from, for the future.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us labour to keep our ſelves <hi>innocent. Saepe delinquenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus promptiſſimum eſt</hi> mentiri. <hi>Faultineſs</hi> commonly cauſeth <hi>faultring,</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> uſually putteth men upon <hi>ſhifts</hi> to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from blame. Take heed therefore of committing <hi>faults,</hi> and then thou wilt not need to <hi>tell a lye</hi> to help thy ſelf. The beſt way to <hi>avoid lying is,</hi> to endeavour alwayes (as much as poſſibly we can) to be faultleſs, and blameleſs. 'Tis too too uſual for <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> when they have done amiſs, and are <hi>blame-worthy,</hi> to ſeek to hide their <hi>faults</hi> with a <hi>lye;</hi> and when they have told <hi>one lye,</hi> that <hi>that</hi> may not be diſcovered or found out, to back it with four or five more, and ſo they heinouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their guilt. But they that labour to walk <hi>innocently</hi> and <hi>blameleſly</hi> need no ſuch miſerable and wretched ſhifts as theſe are.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us fear the <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> of God more than the wrath of men. If we be affraid of mans anger for our faults, (which is but ſhort, and tranſient) how ſhould we fear the <hi>inſupportable wrath</hi> and <hi>vengeance</hi> of God, which is everlaſting. The <hi>one</hi> is but like a <hi>drop of ſcalding water</hi> falling on our fleſh; the <hi>other</hi> like <hi>being thrown</hi> into a furnace of <hi>boyling metal.</hi> No mans diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (how <hi>hot</hi> ſoever) is to be named the ſame day with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Almighty. Your <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>Maſters</hi> may be angry with you, and threaten to correct you, but God threatens to damn you; and which of theſe two are you moſt to conſider?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Think it a leſs evil to take ſhame to thy ſelf by <hi>confeſſing thy fault,</hi> than to hide it with a <hi>lye.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Pride</hi> that makes peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo impatient of the hard opinion of others. And ſhame is
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:66289:143"/> to ſome perſons ſo intolerable a ſuffering, that they will rather venture to diſpleaſe <hi>God</hi> than <hi>man,</hi> and choſe rather to <hi>tell a lye</hi> and expoſe themſelves thereby to the wrath of God, than indure a <hi>little ſhame</hi> or diſgrace from men. Whereas if they had a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and diſcerning of the difference between <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> they would think it far the better courſe to take <hi>ſhame</hi> to themſelves by confeſſing their faults than to hide it with a <hi>lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Labour to foreſee in what particulars, and upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions you may (in all likelihood) be moſt in danger of <hi>faultring,</hi> or <hi>telling a lye,</hi> and there ſet a ſtricter <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>guard</hi> upon your ſelf, fortifying your ſelf with the greter care and caution againſt this vice.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Labour to keep your conſciences tender, that it may <hi>ſmite</hi> you when you are apt to <hi>warp,</hi> or ſtart aſide from your duty. And <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence your conſcience,</hi> when it <hi>checks</hi> you, and <hi>liſten</hi> to it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Live as in the <hi>ſight</hi> and hearing of God, and walk as <hi>one</hi> that is <hi>paſſing on</hi> to judgment.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Labour to get a <hi>keen hatred</hi> and <hi>deteſtation</hi> of this vice. Repreſent it to your thoughts as a ſin of an <hi>odious</hi> and <hi>ſhameful</hi> nature. And if you be affraid of ſhame, be affraid of <hi>lying</hi> which is in it ſelf ſo ſhameful.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Earneſtly implore the <hi>grace of God</hi> to keep you from this ſin. Earneſtly beg of God that you may never be left to your ſelf at any time, or upon any occaſion whatever.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Set a watch over the <hi>doors of your lips.</hi> Take heed of ſpeaking <hi>haſtily,</hi> or <hi>raſhly,</hi> or <hi>too much.</hi> For <hi>in the multitude of words</hi> this <hi>ſin</hi> is ſeldom wanting.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Take heed of a <hi>greedy,</hi> and an <hi>immoderate</hi> deſire of <hi>gain.</hi> How many <hi>trading</hi> people for a ſmall and inconſiderable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for a <hi>two-penny</hi> or <hi>three-penny</hi> matter will not ſtick to <hi>tell a lye,</hi> and <hi>deceive.</hi> Hear what the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> preached in his days. Chap. 6. v. 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>The Lords voice cryeth unto the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c. Are there yet the treaſures of wickedneſs in the houſe of the wicked, and the ſcant meaſure, that is abominable? ſhall I count them pure with the wicked ballances, and with the bag of deceitful weights? For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof have ſpoken lyes, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. Therefore will I make thee ſick in ſmiting thee, in making thee deſolate becauſe of thy ſins.</hi> We read in the fourth of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:66289:144"/> 
                  <hi>Matthew,</hi> 8.9. <hi>v.</hi> that the <hi>Devil</hi> took our Saviour up into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>high Mountain,</hi> and <hi>ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them;</hi> that is (as I ſuppoſe) pointed to him where they lay, and told him, that <hi>all theſe would he give him, if he would fall down, and worſhip him.</hi> But alaſs! the <hi>Devil</hi> need not bid ſo <hi>high</hi> for the ſouls of men now a-days. If he take them but into a <hi>fair,</hi> or <hi>market,</hi> or into a <hi>ſhop,</hi> for a <hi>ſmall gain</hi> they will <hi>lye</hi> and <hi>ſerve</hi> him.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Take heed of <hi>envy,</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> which often put people upon <hi>lying.</hi> When men owe ſuch and ſuch perſons <hi>ill will,</hi> they care not what they ſay of them.</p>
               <p>How <hi>ſad,</hi> and <hi>corrupt</hi> were the <hi>times</hi> wherein the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> lived, who in his ninth Chapter, verſe 4.5. ſpeaks to the <hi>Jews</hi> after this manner, <hi>Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and truſt ye not in any brother; for every brother will utterly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant, and every neighbour will walk with ſlanders, and they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not ſpeak the truth. They have taught their tongue to ſpeak lyes, and weary themſelves to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit iniquity.</hi> So the Prophet <hi>David</hi> complained in his time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Help Lord, for the Godly man ceaſeth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. They ſpeak vanity every one with his neighbour, with flattering lips, and with a double heart do they ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Labour for a <hi>plain ſpirit without guile,</hi> and repreſent to your thoughts the <hi>amiableneſs</hi> thereof. Remember what is the <hi>note</hi> or <hi>character</hi> of a <hi>Godly</hi> man, Prov. 13.5. <hi>A righteous man hateth lying, but a wicked man is loathſome, and cometh to ſhame.</hi> Think with your ſelf <hi>how ill</hi> you ſhould like it, that thoſe, whom you deal with ſhould <hi>lye to you,</hi> or <hi>deceive you,</hi> and why ſhould you then do ſo to them?</p>

               <p n="18">18. Avoid thoſe <hi>two great Jeſuitical tricks,</hi> viz. <hi>equivocation</hi> and <hi>mental reſervation.

                     <item>2. What <hi>Pride</hi> is, wherein the nature of it conſiſts, and what are the <hi>ſigns</hi> and <hi>evidences</hi> of it.</item>
                     <item>3. The great <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>malignity</hi> of it.</item>

               <p>For the <hi>Firſt.</hi> There are <hi>ſome things</hi> that look like <hi>Pride</hi> (and make men cenſured for <hi>proud</hi>) which are not ſo, ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When a <hi>man in authority,</hi> whether <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> or <hi>Miniſter,</hi> having a Spirit ſuitable to his place and work, and caſting off all <hi>puſillanimity</hi> and irregular fear of men, and by Faith eyeing God, and deſigning to pleaſe him, does his duty <hi>couragiouſly,</hi> leaving iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues and events to him. This is not <hi>Pride,</hi> but <hi>Chriſtian courage</hi> and reſolution, and a gracious gift of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When <hi>Magiſtrates, Parents,</hi> or <hi>Maſters</hi> do maintain the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>decorum</hi> of their <hi>place</hi> and <hi>degree,</hi> and do keep <hi>that diſtance</hi> from their inferiours, which is needful for <hi>their good,</hi> and that the <hi>inferiours</hi> may pay them that <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>reſpect,</hi> which is required of them. This is not to be accounted <hi>Pride,</hi> but the behaving a mans ſelf <hi>worthily</hi> in his place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When a man does prefer the <hi>commands of God</hi> before the <hi>commands of men,</hi> and is more fearful of offending God, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the diſpleaſure of men, this is not to be accounted <hi>Pride,</hi> but a <hi>duty.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and poſſibly ſome others will call thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>deſpiſers of Government,</hi> who will not obey them in all their uſurpations. And thus <hi>proud men</hi> call others proud, who cannot crouch and yield to them in the exerciſe of their Pride.</p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:66289:146"/>
               <p n="4">4. When a man hath a <hi>due</hi> and <hi>honeſt</hi> care to maintain and uphold his <hi>credit, good name</hi> and <hi>reputation,</hi> not meerly for it ſelf; but as it may make him more uſeful and ſerviceable to God in his generation. This is not to be accounted <hi>Pride,</hi> but a duty that Chriſtian prudence requires of him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> or <hi>private Chriſtian</hi> does plainly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly reprove an offending brother, out of a true deſire of his amendment and reformation. <hi>This</hi> is not to be accounted <hi>Pride,</hi> or <hi>Pragmaticalneſs,</hi> but the diſcharge of an excellent <hi>Chriſtian duty,</hi> which is by ſo much the more excellent, becauſe it is ſo much neglected, and is ſo hard to perform in a <hi>right manner.</hi> And ſo much for the firſt particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I come now to ſhew <hi>what Pride is,</hi> and wherein the <hi>nature</hi> of it con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>In the general, <hi>Pride is an inordinate ſelf-exalting,</hi> and <hi>overva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing of our ſelves;</hi>

                  </note> and eſteeming our ſelves to be wiſer and better than indeed we are, and an eager deſire, that <hi>others</hi> ſhould ſo think of us, ſo <hi>ſpeak</hi> of us, ſo treat us. And this <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of mind,</hi> this <hi>inordinate ſelf-eſteem</hi> manifeſts it ſelf in <hi>ſundry Particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. When men aſſume that glory and honour to themſelves, which ought to be reflected and aſcribed entirely to God. As <hi>Herod</hi> did, when the people applauded him, and cried, <hi>The voice of a God and not of a man.</hi> The Texts ſayes, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.20. <hi>&amp;c. The Angel of the Lord immediately ſmote him, becauſe he gave not God the glory, and he was eaten up of worms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When they are too highly conceited of their own <hi>wit, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, care</hi> and <hi>contrivance,</hi> and aſcribe their <hi>ſucceſſes</hi> unto <hi>that,</hi> and ſo <hi>Sacrifice to their own net,</hi> not owning, or acknowledging the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favour and providence of God therein as they ought to do. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.13, 14, 17, 18. <hi>When thy herds and thy flocks multiply and thy ſilver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou haſt is multiplied, then beware leſt thy heart be lifted up, and thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Lord thy God (which brought thee out of the land of Aegypt from the houſe of bondage) And thou ſay in thine heart, my power, and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth. But thou ſhalt remember the Lord thy God; for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. When they <hi>brag,</hi> and <hi>boaſt,</hi> and are conceited of their own
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:66289:146"/> 
                  <hi>knowledge, worth, parts,</hi> and <hi>excellencies,</hi> and their <hi>acceptance</hi> with others <hi>Thraſo-like.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. When they <hi>contemn, ſlight, ſcorn,</hi> and <hi>undervalue</hi> others, and their performances, <hi>crying up</hi> what they <hi>do</hi> themſelves, but deſpiſing, and vilifying what is done by others.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When they are apt to be very <hi>angry</hi> and <hi>cholerick</hi> at any thing that agrees not with their own humor, and are impatient to be contradicted, be their <hi>ſpeech right or wrong. Proud, and haughty ſcorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath,</hi> Prov. 21.24.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When they are apt to be <hi>contentious</hi> and <hi>quarrelſom,</hi> and that upon <hi>ſmall matters. Only by Pride cometh contention, but with the well adviſed is wiſdom,</hi> Prov. 13.10. <hi>He that is of a proud heart ſtirreth up ſtrife,</hi> Prov. 28.25.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When men are <hi>headdy, ſelf-willed, head-ſtrong,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſwadable,</hi> though never ſo great reaſons be offered them, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves wiſer than other men.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When they affect <hi>ſingularity</hi> without reaſon, and go in <hi>by-paths</hi> by themſelves, not ordinarily trodden by others, that they may be the more <hi>taken notice of.</hi> A ſober traveller that rides in the ordinary road is not ſo much obſerved as he that jumps over hedge and ditch, and rides in wayes untrodden by others. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed good men in evil dayes are ſometimes compelled to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular (as <hi>Lot</hi> was in <hi>Sodom</hi>) but they do not <hi>affect</hi> it, could they avoid it without ſin.</p>
               <p n="9">9. When they are <hi>cenſorious</hi> and <hi>uncharitable,</hi> and love to carp and find fault with others. They are not ſo <hi>quick-ſighted</hi> to ſee their own failings, as the failings of others.</p>
               <p n="10">10. When they will not <hi>confeſs a fault,</hi> nor <hi>retract an error;</hi> though convinced of it, but out of pride and height of Spirit, juſtifie and defend it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. When they think <hi>diminutively</hi> and <hi>ſlightly</hi> of great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and undervalue them, becauſe they ſee others injoy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When they are apt to be <hi>diſcontented,</hi> to <hi>murmur,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine</hi> if they have not all they deſire, and if <hi>all things</hi> go not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their wills.</p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:66289:147"/>
               <p n="13">13. When they are apt to <hi>fret</hi> and be impatient under the <hi>afflictions</hi> God layes upon them, not conſidering what greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments their ſins deſerve.</p>
               <p n="14">14. When they envy the <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>gifts,</hi> or the <hi>imployments</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> or the <hi>credit</hi> and <hi>reputation</hi> of others, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>diminiſhed</hi> or <hi>leſſened</hi> thereby.</p>
               <p n="15">15. When they are more careful about the <hi>outſide</hi> than the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide</hi> of their duties, and are more ſolicitous how they are liked and approved by <hi>men</hi> after a duty, than how they have approved their hearts and conſciences to God in the duty.</p>
               <p n="16">16. When they are impatient of <hi>reproof,</hi> and of <hi>that diſcipline</hi> Chriſt hath appointed in his Church. Our Saviour <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. hath appointed that an <hi>offending brother ſhould be firſt dealt with by private admonition.</hi> If that will not reform him, then <hi>he is to be admoniſhed by two or three.</hi> If he do not amend <hi>upon that, then</hi> he is to be admoniſhed <hi>more publickly</hi> by the Church. If he ſtill continue <hi>obſtinate and unreformed,</hi> then the Church is to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate</hi> him, and the <hi>members</hi> of it are to <hi>ſhun him as a Heathen man,</hi> or a <hi>Publican,</hi> that ſeeing himſelf looked upon (for the preſent) as an <hi>incorrigible perſon,</hi> he may be aſhamed of his <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>folly.</hi> Now proud perſons, of all others, are moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of living under <hi>this diſcipline,</hi> and are apt to think it a burden inſupportable (ſome of them have called it the burden of <hi>Iſſacar</hi>) that they cannot be permitted <hi>to live as they liſt,</hi> or that they ſhould be barred of any of Chriſts <hi>Ordinances,</hi> or that any ſhould controul them.</p>
               <p n="17">17. When they are exceſſively <hi>hard and difficult to be pleaſed,</hi> and are too ridged exacters of obſervance and reſpect from their inferiors.</p>
               <p n="18">18. When they <hi>love others</hi> not according to their true worth, but according to the meaſure of reſpect which they ſhew to them.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>Proud</hi> perſons are uſually moſt <hi>injurious</hi> both in words and actions towards weak adverſaries.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Proud perſons are very <hi>reſentful</hi> of any injuries either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> done to them, and when <hi>they are wronged,</hi> they look for <hi>great ſubmiſſion</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>Pride</hi> makes people exceeding loath to be <hi>beholding to others.</hi> Some will almoſt ſtarve rather than make their wants known.</p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:66289:147"/>
               <p n="22">22. The <hi>Pride of the heart</hi> very often ſhews and manifeſts its ſelf in the <hi>vanity of the garb and attire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. <hi>Pride many times</hi> makes people to ſlight the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of God, and to hear their teachers, as <hi>Judges,</hi> not as <hi>Learners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. <hi>Pride</hi> very often makes thoſe <hi>in place</hi> apt to domineer over their <hi>inferiours,</hi> and to think of the <hi>dignity</hi> of their places more than of the <hi>duty</hi> they owe to God, and the people in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

Conſider, that <hi>Pride</hi> is a <hi>very ruining ſin.</hi> It undid <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.6. and <hi>our firſt Parents.</hi> It overthrew the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Babel,</hi> drowned <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> proſtrated <hi>Goliah,</hi> hanged <hi>Haman,</hi> deſtroyed <hi>Senacharib,</hi> made <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> like a beaſt, cauſed <hi>Herod</hi> to be eaten up with lice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.25.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis a very diſquieting ſin. (1.) 'Tis a great <hi>disquieter</hi> of a mans <hi>own Soul.</hi> Every little thing caſts a proud man into a paſſion. It renders his life miſerable, and puts him in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of any man to be his tormentor. A <hi>ſmall neglect</hi> or <hi>affront</hi> diſorders a proud man even almoſt to diſtraction. A remarkable inſtance hereof we have in <hi>Haman,</hi> Eſther 3.5. (2.) It is a great <hi>diſquieter</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> a great occaſion of <hi>diſquiet in private families,</hi> and ſo likewiſe in Pariſhes, it makes men <hi>very firebrands</hi> in the places where they live; It makes them full of animoſity againſt thoſe that croſs them in any thing, and full of <hi>envy</hi> at thoſe that are above them. And ſo in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> none ſo <hi>troubleſome</hi> as proud perſons. Look alſo upon the lamentable effects of it in the world. <hi>O curſed Pride, thou child of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> how doſt thou ſet the whole world on fire? what woful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, contentions and miſchiefs doſt thou cauſe where thou prevaileſt.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Pride</hi> uſually <hi>blaſts parts.</hi> It blinds the <hi>mind,</hi> and makes people over confident of their own conceits. 'Tis alſo very frequently the <hi>high-way</hi> to <hi>Apoſtacy.</hi> Mark thoſe that are <hi>proud</hi> in a <hi>Pariſh,</hi> or <hi>family,</hi> and if there come any <hi>infection</hi> of <hi>ſchiſm,</hi> or <hi>hereſie</hi> near them, <hi>they</hi> are commonly the <hi>firſt</hi> that catch it.</p>

               <p n="4">4. I come now in the fourth place to give ſome <hi>remedies</hi> and directions againſt it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Enter into a ſerious conſideration of thy own <hi>vileneſs.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>E Coelo deſcendit</hi> Noſce te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſum.</note> Conſider the <hi>infirmities, weakneſſes,</hi> and <hi>ſickneſſes</hi> of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but eſpecially the great depravedneſs of thy Soul. Want of due and ſerious conſideration and deſcending into a mans ſelf is the great cauſe of Pride. Meditate on thy manifold ſins, and the deſerts of them, and meditate on <hi>thy weakneſſes,</hi> and <hi>miſeries,</hi> and then tell me whether thou haſt any cauſe to be proud.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Often meditate on the <hi>glorious nature and attributes of God;</hi> on his <hi>infinite greatneſs, holineſs and purity,</hi> and tha is one <hi>good means to abaſe thee,</hi> and make thee to abhor thy ſelf. <hi>Job</hi> 42.5, 6. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee; Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider how d declares, that he <hi>hates, abhors, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts</hi> a proud perſon. nd he muſt needs fall, whom God ſets
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:66289:148"/> himſelf againſt. He <hi>reſiſts the proud, but his grace and favour is towards the lowly. Every one that is proud in heart is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord,</hi> Prove 16.5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Look upon the great <hi>imperfection of thy graces,</hi> and thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold <hi>failings</hi> even in thy beſt duties. <hi>Ex ignorantia tui venit ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbia.</hi> Ignorance of thy ſelf is the cauſe of thy Pride.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Look upon our <hi>humble Saviour. Nulla creatura humilior Deo,</hi> ſayes <hi>Laurentius</hi> excellently. The moſt powerful ſight in the world, for the humbling of the ſoul is a Crucified Saviour. What an example of humility hath he left us? His whole life was a conſtant Lecture of Humility. He condeſcended ſo <hi>low</hi> as to <hi>waſh his Diſciples feet,</hi> John 13. <hi>Non ex officio, ſed ex amore, &amp; in exemplum,</hi> as one ſayes upon the place.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Look on the holy Angels how they humble themſelves, and condeſcend to miniſter for the good of the people of God, who are ſo much their inferiors.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Look upon the <hi>examples</hi> of the moſt <hi>eminent Saints,</hi> and you will find they were <hi>eminent</hi> in this grace of humility. See inſtances hereof in <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18.27. <hi>Behold now I have taken upon me to ſpeak to the Lord, who am but duſt and aſhes.</hi> In <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.10. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant, for with my ſtaff I paſſed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.</hi> In <hi>David</hi> 1 Sam. 7.18. And <hi>David ſaid, who am I O Lord God, and what is mine houſe that thou haſt brought me hitherto?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Look upon the <hi>Devils</hi> themſelves, that tempt you to be proud. See what <hi>Pride</hi> hath brought them unto. A <hi>proud man</hi> is the very <hi>image</hi> of the Devil. <hi>Pride, Malice, Hatred, and Lying</hi> are the Devils peculiar ſins. And can it be pleaſing to you to be like unto him?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Conſider how God does uſually leave <hi>proud perſons</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at one time or other, and ſuffer them to fall into ſome <hi>ſin</hi> or <hi>miſcarriage,</hi> that ſo they may be <hi>abaſed</hi> and <hi>humbled.</hi> One <hi>indiſcreet action</hi> of a man <hi>left to himſelf,</hi> may throw down the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> that he has by great <hi>caution and circumſpection</hi> been many years in raiſing, and make him <hi>vile</hi> in the eyes of the world.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Conſid. that thoſe that are proud are uſually near ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fall, or heavy judgment. God himſelf hath made <hi>Pride</hi> a ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, or prognoſtick of it. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.11. <hi>Whoſoever exalteth
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:66289:149"/> himſelf ſhall be abaſed, and he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> and Chap. 1.51. <hi>He hath ſcattered the proud in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of their hearts. He hath put down the mighty from their ſeat, and exalted them of low degree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Reaſon thy ſelf into a <hi>loathing</hi> of this ſin. Ask thy ſelf, <hi>what art thou, what haſt thou, what canſt thou do</hi> that thou ſhouldſt be proud?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is it thy <hi>birth</hi> thou art proud of? If thy Parents were of <hi>great quality</hi> and of <hi>great virtue,</hi> thou oughteſt to look to it that thou imitate them in their worthy behaviour, and vertuous life, elſe thou wilt be a diſhonour to them. If they were great in this world, and <hi>vitious,</hi> thou haſt no cauſe to boaſt of thy <hi>deſcent</hi> from them, but to take heed of <hi>treading in their ſteps,</hi> leſt a curſe be intailed upon thee from them. Beſides, conſider that <hi>perſonal merits</hi> render any man imcomparably more valuable than his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to very deſerving Anceſtors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it <hi>Riches?</hi> The more thou haſt, the greater will be thy account. Our Saviour tells us <hi>'tis hard for a rich man</hi> (eſpecially ſuch an one as <hi>truſts in his riches) to enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Mark 10.23, 24. Few <hi>rich</hi> men eſcape the ſnare. Thy <hi>account</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> ſhould rather make thee <hi>fear,</hi> than thy riches <hi>lift thee up.</hi> Or if thou haſt riches, 'tis very uncertain whether thou wilt carry them to thy grave. There are many accidents that may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh thee. Or if thou doſt carry them to thy grave, thou canſt carry them no farther, but there muſt leave them, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly either to a <hi>fool</hi> or a <hi>prodigal.</hi> 'Tis often ſeen, the faſter men gripe and think to hold their wealth, the ſooner they looſe it, like him that gripes <hi>Callice-ſand</hi> in his fiſt, the harder he gripes it, the faſter it ſlips away from him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is it <hi>Power</hi> thou art proud of? So great will be the account that men in power muſt give, how they have improved <hi>that Talent,</hi> (whether for God, or againſt him) that the very thoughts of it may <hi>affright</hi> any <hi>conſidering,</hi> man. Thou haſt need well conſider how thou haſt improved <hi>thy power,</hi> whether for the intereſt of God, and the <hi>good of the world,</hi> or only to ſerve thy own or other mens luſts, as too many do.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is it thy <hi>learning</hi> thou art proud of? certainly the <hi>more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> thou art the more humble thou oughteſt to be. True know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge diſcovers the folly and pernitious tendency of <hi>Pride,</hi> and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:66289:149"/> affords abundant matter for <hi>Humility.</hi> The <hi>heavieſt,</hi> and moſt weighty heads of <hi>corn</hi> bow down themſelves, the <hi>empty ones</hi> perk up themſelves. Conſider alſo how little thou knoweſt of what is <hi>knowable,</hi> and of what thou mighteſt, and oughteſt to know. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs! Thy learning is but a pitiful narrow thing in reſpect of the <hi>amplitude</hi> of things that are to be known.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Is it <hi>Beauty</hi> or <hi>bodily ſtrength</hi> thou art proud of? Alaſs! poſſibly a <hi>diſeaſe</hi> at this very moment is breeding in thee that will ſuddenly pull down thy ſtrength, and deface thy beauty. And obſerve it who will, that <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>beauty,</hi> that raiſes <hi>Pride</hi> is commonly ſhort lived. For <hi>vain-glory</hi> commonly putteth <hi>great ſtrength</hi> upon dangerous and perilous attempts and undertakings, which uſually do indanger and hurt it, if not deſtroy it. And that beauty which is ſet forth to be a temptation to luſt, and diſhoneſty, is commonly the ruiner of its owner. <hi>That beauty</hi> is beſt ſet off which is attended <hi>with the ornament of a meek, and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price.</hi> If God hath given thee <hi>beauty,</hi> let it ſtir up thy gratitude, and not be a ground of pride to thee.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Is it <hi>Wit</hi> or good <hi>natural parts</hi> that thou art proud of? Alaſs! how ſoon may a <hi>fever</hi> or <hi>apoplexy</hi> deprive thee of thy <hi>memory, wit and underſtanding?</hi> Beſides, <hi>obſerve</hi> it, <hi>wit</hi> is never ſooner foiled than by <hi>Pride. Pride</hi> caſteth a <hi>ridiculouſneſs</hi> and a <hi>kind of blot upon</hi> the greateſt parts. Such an one hath <hi>good parts</hi> (ſaith the common by-word) but he <hi>knows it too well. Pride</hi> alſo often times draws up into the brain, ſuch <hi>hot cholerick vapours</hi> and <hi>fumes</hi> as diſorder and diſcompoſe it. But <hi>humility and lowlineſs of mind</hi> is a great advantage for the improving of all our faculties. It <hi>cools</hi> and <hi>qualifies</hi> the blood and ſpirits, and keeps the whole man in a good frame and temper. Beſides thoſe that are <hi>conceited of their wit,</hi> do uſually (at one time or other) run into ſome <hi>extravagancy,</hi> renders them deſpicable and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. 'Tis <hi>ten</hi> to <hi>one</hi> but their <hi>Pride</hi> will carry them into ſome <hi>ridiculous action,</hi> ſo that they will receive more <hi>reproach and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> for their <hi>pride,</hi> than they received before applauſe for their <hi>parts?</hi> 'Tis far more deſirable to be a <hi>wiſe</hi> man than a <hi>witty</hi> man. When therefore thou art apt to ſwell with Pride, at the reflexion upon thy parts, think <hi>how many</hi> there are in the world <hi>more wiſe and

               <p n="8">8. Is it <hi>fine cloaths</hi> thou art proud of? All Pride is a very <hi>fooliſh</hi> thing, but that which ariſes from ſuch <hi>mean things,</hi> is the moſt <hi>irrational</hi> of all. Alaſs! you muſt ſhortly change all your <hi>finery for grave-cloaths,</hi> and that <hi>vile body</hi> of yours that now you endeavour with ſo much art and coſt to deck and adorn muſt ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be laid in the duſt. <hi>Fine cloaths</hi> may make <hi>Children and young folks proud,</hi> but <hi>wiſe and conſidering perſons</hi> are not uſually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with ſuch things. <hi>Be cloathed with humility</hi> ſayes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 Pet. 5.5. that is the <hi>beſt cloathing of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Is it <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>goodneſs</hi> that thou art apt to be proud of? This is a thing very irrational and abſurd. For <hi>predominant pride</hi> cannot conſiſt with grace, but is a <hi>great ſign</hi> of a graceleſs ſtate. If thou haſt grace, ſo far as thou art proud of it, thou doſt abuſe it, contradict it, and act againſt the very nature of it. For Pride is to grace what a conſumption is to health. <hi>Be not high minded, but fear,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, Rom. 11.20. <hi>When you think you ſtand, take heed leſt you fall.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.12. And thus much of the eleventh Direction; namely, that we ſhould reaſon our ſelves into a loathing of this ſin.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Look on the humbling judgments of God that are abroad in the world, and turn them all as ſo many Cannons againſt thy Pride. Methinks every ſerious Chriſtian ſhould think it unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and unſuitable in ſuch a calamitous time as this is, when God calls to humbling and abaſing our ſelves, and to ſympathize with others that are in an afflicted <hi>condition,</hi> now to <hi>lay it out in pride</hi> and <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>gariſh garbes</hi> and <hi>attire</hi> more than formerly. We have ſeen many humbling ſights, and felt many humbling ſtrokes, and have heard many diſmal cries of our afflicted Brethren and ſhall we now be proud? I know the world is at that paſs, that a <hi>Miniſter</hi> will be thought to do more wiſely to ſave his breath than ſpend it upon <hi>ſo hopeleſs a deſign</hi> as to think by all
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:66289:150"/> his <hi>arguments</hi> to reform people in this particular. The <hi>pride</hi> of the world is now <hi>too high</hi> to be born down by Sermons or the moſt earneſt and ſerious exhortations. Alas! 'Tis a <hi>monſter,</hi> that has not been conquered by <hi>War,</hi> nor <hi>Plague,</hi> nor <hi>Fire.</hi> And do you think it will be born down by the breath of a poor Miniſter, though exhorting never ſo ſeriouſly. However, we muſt do <hi>our duty,</hi> and <hi>lift up our voice like a Trumpet, and ſhew Iſrael their ſins, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear.</hi> And if I can bring but one ſinner (who is concerned in this reproof) to conſider his wayes, and to forſake his pride and vanity I ſhall not repent me of this pains.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Conſider how God in the <hi>contrivance</hi> of mans redemption deſigneth <hi>the humbling</hi> of all whom he intends to ſave. For he hath ordained that no man ſhall be juſtified by a righteouſneſs of his own performance, but by the <hi>ſatisfaction, merits,</hi> and <hi>interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Redeemer.</hi> Therefore he prepareth men for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this pardon, by humbling them and making them vile and mean in thir own eyes.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Read what Chriſt expects from them whom he intends to ſave, and then you will ſee what a <hi>great meaſure of humility</hi> and ſelf-denial is required of them. <hi>Except ye become as little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ye cannot enter into the Kindom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 18.3.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Treaſure up ſome <hi>Scripture precepts</hi> againſt <hi>Pride,</hi> and have them alwayes ready in your minds, ſuch as theſe, <hi>he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted. God reſiſteth the proud. Pride goeth before a fall. Every one that is proud in heart is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 16.5. <hi>A mans Pride ſhall bring him low, but honour ſhall uphold the humble in ſpirit,</hi> Prov. 29.23.</p>

               <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>counterfeits</hi> of it. There are four things that carry a ſhew of humility, but are at a great diſtance from it.</p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:66289:151"/>
               <p n="1">1. When men <hi>vilifie and diſcommend</hi> themſelves, or <hi>their own performances,</hi> on purpoſe to draw others to praiſe them. He that doth ſo, <hi>cozens</hi> himſelf into Pride by a ſhew of Humility. A man would be aſhamed if he were told, he uſed that <hi>mean ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem</hi> to procure his own praiſe. But ſo glorious a thing is <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> that <hi>pride</hi> to hide its own ſhame, does ſometimes put on the <hi>vizor</hi> and ſemblance of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When men effect to wear ſome <hi>unuſual habit,</hi> or ſome <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>ſordid cloaths,</hi> or to uſe ſome <hi>clowniſh, unhandſome,</hi> and <hi>uncivil</hi> behaviour, which may make them <hi>taken notice of,</hi> and obſerved by others. This may look like <hi>Humility,</hi> but is far from it. There may be a <hi>ruſſet Pride, and a leathern Inſolency.</hi> 'Tis not alwayes couched under <hi>ſilk</hi> and <hi>ſattin.</hi> Many times there is a very <hi>ugly pride</hi> under mean cloaths. The <hi>Capuchins</hi> among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> go in poor cloaths with <hi>naked legs,</hi> and <hi>Sandals.</hi> Who hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe things of them? I think the Apoſtles rule is here to be obſerved, <hi>whatſoever things are honeſt, pure, lovely, and of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> and praiſe-worthy among men, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. Theſe we ſhould follow and not affect a vain ſignularity not warranted by the word of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When they chooſe to converſe for the moſt part with their <hi>inferiours,</hi> that they may <hi>bear ſway,</hi> and be the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> among them, this is no argument of <hi>Humility</hi> but rather of <hi>Pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. When men live <hi>baſely, meanly,</hi> in no degree anſwerable, or according to the eſtate and condition God hath put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; this is not <hi>humility,</hi> but an argument of a <hi>covetous</hi> and <hi>ſordid</hi> ſpirit. And ſo much of the <hi>counterfeits</hi> of humility.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I come now to ſhew wherein the <hi>true nature of Humility</hi> conſiſts, and in what <hi>particulars</hi> it evidenceth it ſelf. In the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. <hi>True Humility</hi> is a <hi>lowly frame</hi> and <hi>temper of Soul</hi> ariſing from <hi>wiſe, ſerious, and deliberate conſideration.</hi> 'Tis principally rooted in the mind, and evidenceth it ſelf in theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Soul that is <hi>truly humble</hi> is deeply ſenſible of its mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>weakneſſes, wants,</hi> and <hi>imperfections.</hi> 'Tis ſenſible of the <hi>darkneſs</hi> of its mind, the <hi>depravedneſs</hi> of its will, the <hi>diſorder</hi> and <hi>irregularity</hi> of its affections.<note n="*" place="margin">Humilitas eſt animi demiſſio or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta ex vera ſtatus &amp; conditionis ſuae agnition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis very ſenſible of its great <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> and manifold tranſgreſſions againſt God. O (ſayes ſuch a Soul) who have I in the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:66289:151"/> whole courſe of my life too much neglected my Creator (who gave me my <hi>life</hi> and <hi>being</hi>) and in <hi>many things</hi> how grievouſly have I ſinned againſt him? And the <hi>wages of every ſin being death,</hi> how obnoxious and liable have I made my ſelf to the wrath and curſe of God? What a mercy is it that I am out of Hell, who have ſo many wayes broken the <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>righteous Law of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As a <hi>conſequent</hi> hereupon, 'tis very ſenſible of its great <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs</hi> of thoſe mercies it enjoyes from God. The humble ſoul ſayes, as <hi>good old Jacob</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all thy mercies, which thou haſt ſhewed to thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The humble Soul is filled with an <hi>high admiring, and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate gratitude</hi> to God, as the <hi>free giver</hi> of all the mercies it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys. 'Tis very thankful for temporals, but much more for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals; and owns all to the <hi>free bounty</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God. The humble Soul is a great admirer of <hi>free grace,</hi> and highly prizes our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his great undertaking for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The humble Soul is patient under <hi>afflictions,</hi> and clears God of any hard dealing in his proceedings againſt him. He <hi>charges not Good fooliſhly,</hi> how ſharp ſoever his afflictions be.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The humble perſon is patient under the <hi>neglects</hi> and <hi>diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects</hi> he meets with from men. 'Tis not for me (ſaith the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soul) to expect or look for <hi>reſpect</hi> and <hi>eſteem</hi> in the World. 'Tis enough for me if among thoſe few good men I am acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, I find a tolerable kind acceptance.</p>
               <p n="7">7. An <hi>humble perſon</hi> doth carefully watch over his <hi>thoughts, words</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> leſt <hi>Pride</hi> or <hi>vain-glory</hi> ſhould ſteal in upon him, and eſpecially he fears leſt he ſhould be puffed up on the account of <hi>thoſe actions,</hi> that meet with ſome <hi>applauſe</hi> and <hi>acceptance</hi> in the world. A man ſhould alwayes endeavour to do things that deſerve honour and eſteem, but then he ſhould not aſſume the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them to himſelf. If he do any thing tending to the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of God, and <hi>the good of the world,</hi> he is very glad of it, and heartily thankful to God for inabling him to do it. But he gives God <hi>intirely</hi> the glory of it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The humble Soul hath a <hi>charitable opinion of others,</hi> which he is the more induced to upon conſideration of his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:66289:152"/> and manifold failings. Where there is the <hi>greateſt humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> commonly there is the <hi>greateſt charity,</hi> but where there is the <hi>higheſt Pride,</hi> there uſually is the greateſt <hi>cenſoriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. An humble perſon ſtrictly animadverts upon, and obſerves his <hi>failings</hi> and <hi>defects</hi> in the <hi>good duties</hi> he performs. He takes notice of the <hi>deadneſs, coldneſs, formality,</hi> and the <hi>degrees of vain-glory,</hi> that are apt to creep in upon him in the performance of them; and <hi>all theſe</hi> are matter of <hi>humiliation</hi> to him. And thus much of the <hi>nature of humility,</hi> and the <hi>particulars</hi> wherein it evidenceth it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I come now in the next place to ſhew the <hi>fruits, benefits</hi> and <hi>advantages</hi> of this <hi>eminent grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>humble man</hi> obtains <hi>grace, favour,</hi> and a <hi>bleſſing</hi> from God. He <hi>gives grace,</hi> that is, he <hi>manifeſts his grace and favour</hi> to the <hi>humble.</hi> The <hi>humble</hi> man doth not uſurp the <hi>glory due</hi> to his <hi>Creator,</hi> nor intercept the <hi>Tribute</hi> which ought to be paid to God, but payes it willingly to the right owner. And God hath declared, that <hi>thoſe that honour him, he will honour.</hi> The <hi>favour</hi> of God is alwayes accompanied with <hi>bounty,</hi> and <hi>beneficence.</hi> But his <hi>Favour</hi> is not to be meaſured by his heaping <hi>temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ral things</hi> on us, but by his bleſſing us with <hi>Soul-mercies</hi> and <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bleſſings</hi> which have a reference to the life that is to come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The humble ſoul ſhall be ſure of Gods <hi>direction,</hi> Pſal. 25.9. He ſhall be guided (firſt) <hi>in the right way to Heaven,</hi> which <hi>thoſe that are wiſe in their own eyes</hi> many times miſerably err from. What did many of thoſe that were <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> (being full of their own <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>learning</hi>) account of the Goſpel? <hi>That</hi> which was in it ſelf the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and moſt <hi>profound</hi> contrivance that ever was in the world, and moſt efficacious inſtrument of mans converſion and ſalvation ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to theſe <hi>men of wiſdom</hi> meer <hi>fooliſhneſs.</hi> (2.) But it was the <hi>power of God unto Salvation,</hi> Rom. 1.16. to all thoſe that were brought thereby to believe in our Lord Jeſus. 2. The humble perſon God will guide in his <hi>worldly affairs</hi> and <hi>buſineſs,</hi> whereas <hi>proud men</hi> (who uſually <hi>lean on their own underſtanding,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain all counſel but what ſuiteth with their own wiſdom) very frequently miſcarry. Let us call our <hi>own experience</hi> to witneſs, whether when (in a deep ſenſe of our own weakneſs, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:66289:152"/> our own <hi>ability</hi> and <hi>wiſdom</hi> to grapple with the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we were to meet with) we have humbly implored the <hi>divine directions,</hi> and <hi>guidance,</hi> and have committed our ſelves thereto, I ſay, let us conſider whether we have not found God helping of us, and caſting our <hi>affairs</hi> better for us than we could have imagined or contrived our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An <hi>humble</hi> perſon is uſually well <hi>thought of</hi> and <hi>ſpoken of</hi> by all that know him, whereas a <hi>proud</hi> man is the mark of <hi>common obloquy.</hi> If a man be proud, almoſt every body is ready to pull him down. Nay, they that are proud themſelves are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enough to pull down others that are proud. But the humble almoſt every body is willing to lift up.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Not one <hi>diſpenſation</hi> of God will paſs without doing us ſome good, if we be <hi>humble. Proſperity</hi> will <hi>better</hi> us, and <hi>adverſity</hi> will <hi>better</hi> us. All <hi>winds</hi> will drive us on towards the <hi>haven</hi> of eternal happineſs, if we be <hi>truly humble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Humility</hi> keeps the ſoul in great tranquillity. The paſſion of <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>haughtineſs</hi> how it vexes and diſquiets the minds of men? but <hi>humility</hi> makes the Soul very ſubmiſſive to the will of God; ſhall not I ſubmit (ſayes the humble ſoul) to the will of my heavenly father, whoſe will I pray daily may be fulfilled. The <hi>cup that my heavenly Father giveth me to drink, ſhall not I drink it?</hi> What am I that I ſhould not be croſſed or reproached? It is but what I deſerve, nay much leſs than I deſerve by reaſon of my ſins. My preſent condition is not ſo troubleſome or painful or uneaſie but I deſerve much more. And ſhall not I be patient and content and ſubmit to my <hi>Soveraign Lord</hi> (to his <hi>wiſdom</hi> as well as to his <hi>will</hi>) who orders all things for the good of them that <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> him? And ſo much of the <hi>third particular,</hi> the <hi>benefits</hi> and <hi>advantages</hi> of humility.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I come now in the laſt place to preſcribe ſome means for the attaining of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider how highly God values and prizes this <hi>temper.</hi> He <hi>dwells</hi> in the <hi>higheſt heavens,</hi> and in the <hi>loweſt hearts,</hi> Iſa. 66.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. The <hi>ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit</hi> is in his <hi>ſight of great price,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.4. And <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.18. ſayes the <hi>Prophet, He hath ſhewed thee O man what is good and what the Lord requires of thee,</hi> namely <hi>to do juſtly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> God takes no pleaſure in us, till he hath
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:66289:153"/> brought us to this frame and temper.<note n="*" place="margin">Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo <hi>coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur.</hi> Caſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odor.</note> Nothing makes us ſo <hi>precious</hi> in Gods ſight as <hi>Humility.</hi> We are moſt <hi>precious</hi> in Gods eyes, when we are moſt <hi>vile</hi> in our own. An humble and a contrite ſpirit is more valued by him than all burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſacrifices.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the <hi>various means</hi> that God uſes to work this ſo <hi>neceſſary a grace</hi> in the hearts of his own people. Sometimes he viſits them with <hi>afflictions,</hi> ſometimes with <hi>temptations,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.</note> nay, ſometimes he ſuffers them to fall into ſin, and all to <hi>humble them. Expedit ſuperbo ut incidat in peccatum</hi> as he ſaid of <hi>old.</hi> And if God ſo much deſires we ſhould be <hi>humble,</hi> ſhall not we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his will therein?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Con. how our bleſſed Lord and Saviour recommended <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to the World. (1.) By his <hi>precepts,</hi> Mat. 11.28. (2.) By his <hi>example,</hi> John 13. <hi>He waſhed his Diſciples feet,</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 6.15. When <hi>they went about to make him a King,</hi> he utterly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it. There is not any one <hi>vertue</hi> that he commandeth and commendeth more than <hi>humility,</hi> nor any one <hi>vice</hi> that he ſets himſelf more againſt than <hi>pride.</hi> In his <hi>Beatitudes,</hi> Matth. 5. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of ſpirit</hi> hath the <hi>firſt</hi> promiſe, and <hi>meekneſs</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> the <hi>third.</hi> And if we look through his whole life, we ſhall find there is not any one grace he did more ſignally exerciſe, or by his example more commend to the imitation of Chriſtians than <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. Let the ſame mind therefore be in us that was in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as the Apoſtle exhorts us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Earneſtly pray to God to help thee in the humbling of thy heart, pour out thy ſoul to the Lord in ſome ſuch petitions as theſe. Lord <hi>take from me (I pray thee) all vanity and fooliſh complacency in my own perſon or actions, and help me to reflect all gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Lord keep me from ſin, folly, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies, and then inable me to receive all leſſenings and diminutions ro m men patiently and contentedly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Converſe often with <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>afflicted</hi> perſons, that ſo thy heart may be affected with their condition, and that thou mayeſt <hi>ſympathize</hi> with them in their ſorrows and ſufferings.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider what a great influence <hi>humility</hi> hath into many other graces. <hi>Repentance, Faith, Love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi> are
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:66289:153"/> much quickned and enlivened by <hi>humility.</hi> None more truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, none more joyfully and thankfully repoſe and rely on the <hi>great ſatisfaction</hi> of Chriſt, none have their hearts more inflamed with <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi> than humble perſons. Lord what am I (ſaith the humble Soul) that ever thou ſhouldſt place thy love on one ſo unworthy? <hi>What am I or what is my fathers houſe,</hi> that thou ſhouldſt deal ſo bountifully with me?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Meditate often on thy own <hi>failings and weakneſſes,</hi> and reflect on the <hi>worſt things</hi> in thee, that ſo thou mayeſt be <hi>abaſed,</hi> and not only on the <hi>beſt</hi> to puff thee up. The <hi>Phariſee</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. cried out, <hi>I thank thee O Lord, I am not as other men are, an extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, unjuſt, an adulterer, or as this Publican;</hi> but the poor <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> cried out <hi>Lord be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Meditate on thy own death, and celebrate thy own Funeral in thy ſerious thoughts and meditations. Methinks ſome ſerious thoughts of <hi>death</hi> and the <hi>grave</hi> ſhould be able to pull down the <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>plumes</hi> of the vaineſt ſpirit.</p>

                  <item>3. Shall ſhew the great evil and danger of it.</item>
                  <item>4. Shall propound ſome helps and remedies againſt it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the <hi>Firſt.</hi> I ſhall firſt ſhew in the <hi>general</hi> what <hi>gluttony</hi> is, and then come to ſpeak more particularly of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gluttony</hi> may be thus deſcribed. <hi>It is a voluntary exceſs in eating for the meer pleaſing of the appetite or ſome other carnal end.</hi> But here I muſt interpoſe three <hi>cautions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſame <hi>quantity</hi> may be an <hi>exceſs</hi> in <hi>one</hi> that is not in <hi>another.</hi> A ſtrong and labouring man may eat a great deal more than a ſtudent or a man of a ſedentary life. Therefore the <hi>exceſs</hi> is not to be eſtimated by the quantity eaten, but by the <hi>condition of the perſon</hi> eating. Ordinarily, that is to be called and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>exceſs,</hi> when a man to pleaſe his appetite, eateth more than is <hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> for his <hi>health,</hi> or to help him on in his duty. And here that excellent rule of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is to be obſerved, who maketh vertue <hi>to conſiſt in the mean, or meaſure,</hi> and <hi>that diſtance from the extremes which the prudence of a prudent man determines.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Virtus conſiſtit in ea medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critate quam vir prudens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fini verit.</note> And ſo in this caſe, the <hi>prudence</hi> of every <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man</hi> muſt determine for him what muſt be his meaſure as to eating.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis not all delight in meat, or pleaſing the appetite, that is a ſin, but only that which is made a mans ultimate end, and is not referred to an higher end. When the delight it ſelf is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to <hi>health</hi> and more <hi>alacrity</hi> in our duty towards God, and in ſerving of him.</p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:66289:154"/>
               <p n="3">3. A difference <hi>as to diet</hi> ought to be allowed to <hi>perſons</hi> and to <hi>times.</hi> (1.) To <hi>perſons.</hi> Some <hi>perſons</hi> may have <hi>better diet,</hi> and more <hi>coſtly</hi> than others. The ſame diet that is fit for <hi>one man</hi> is not fit for <hi>another.</hi> A <hi>great man</hi> may have thoſe <hi>ſorts of meats,</hi> which would be unfit (ordinarily) and too chargeable for a poor man. (2.) To <hi>times. Times of Thanksgiving</hi> and <hi>rejoycing</hi> may be allowed a more liberal proviſion, and <hi>large exceedings,</hi> than is convenient at other times. As we ſee our Saviour at a <hi>Wedding</hi> in <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee</hi> turned <hi>water</hi> into <hi>wine,</hi> that the <hi>gueſts</hi> on ſuch a day of chearfulneſs and rejoycing, might have a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful proviſion. Yet temperance is then alſo to be obſerved, <hi>exceſs</hi> being never allowable, but alwayes to be avoided. Having thus ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Gluttony</hi> in the <hi>general,</hi> I come now to ſhew more <hi>particularly</hi> wherein it conſiſts?</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis ſometimes an <hi>exceſs in quantity,</hi> when more is eaten than is meet and fit, or than the ſtomach can well carry off or digeſt. And ſo by <hi>imperfect concoction</hi> abundance of <hi>crudities</hi> and vitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are bred, which prepare and diſpoſe the body to ſickneſſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes in <hi>quality,</hi> when the meats that are eaten are too young, or too delicate and coſtly, and when there is too great a curioſity in dreſſing and ſaucing of them, or when ſuch meats are delighted in, which are apt and proper to excite and pamper luſt and wantonneſs, or when they are ſuch as are intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the appetite after it is well ſatisfied, and needs no more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes in the <hi>manner of eating.</hi> As (1.) When men eat too eagerly and with too much greedineſs, and too voracious an appetite. (2.) When they eat too often and too ſoon, before their former meal is digeſted, not allowing nature ſufficient time of concoction. And ſo much of the nature of <hi>Gluttony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I come now to inquire into the cauſes of it. There are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An <hi>inordinate appetite,</hi> and a mind too much ſet upon <hi>Fleſh-pleaſing. They that are after the fleſh do mind the the things of the fleſh,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. There are ſome who too much delight in eating and feeding, making their belly their God, like <hi>Philoxenus</hi> who wiſhed he had the <hi>neck of a Crane</hi> that he might have the <hi>longer delight</hi> in ſwallowing, and taſting his <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink.</hi> Theſe people ſhould remember, that the fleſh is one of the <hi>enemies</hi> they are engaged <hi>by their baptiſm</hi> to fight
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:66289:155"/> againſt, and therefore ſhould not pamper it unto wantonneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Want of <hi>due underſtanding</hi> what is truly conducing to <hi>health,</hi> and to the furthering of us in our duty towards God and man. A <hi>decaying body</hi> ought carefully to be ſupported, but an <hi>unruly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> ought carefully to be ſubdued. And they that do not duly conſider their own <hi>conſtitution</hi> and what is the <hi>duty incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them</hi> in reference to their particular Temper and the ſtate of their bodies, will be apt to erre in this matter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Making <hi>appetite</hi> the <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi> of our eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereas <hi>appetite</hi> was given to us to make that grateful to us which reaſon bids us to eat, and not to be our meaſure. Many a mans <hi>appetite</hi> is ſtronger than his <hi>concoction,</hi> and many <hi>healthful</hi> people have an appetite to more than they ought to eat, or than <hi>nature</hi> can well digeſt. We ſee in <hi>Swine</hi> and many <hi>greedy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> that they would many times even kill themſelves with eating, if they had not the <hi>reaſon of others</hi> to govern them. <hi>Appetite</hi> therefore is not to be <hi>our rule</hi> either for <hi>quantity</hi> or <hi>quality</hi> of meats, but <hi>reaſon</hi> in <hi>this</hi> (as in <hi>other things</hi>) is to be our guide and governor. When <hi>reaſon</hi> hath nothing againſt it, then <hi>appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite</hi> ſheweth what is moſt agreeable to nature and what the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is like beſt to cloſe with and digeſt. But God hath given us <hi>reaſon</hi> as well as <hi>appetite,</hi> and though (as the common ſaying is)<note n="*" place="margin">Venter non habet aures.</note> the <hi>belly and the appetite hath no ears,</hi> yet <hi>reaſon</hi> ſhould make them hear, yea and obey too.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The exceeding <hi>deliciouſneſs</hi> and <hi>pleaſantneſs</hi> of ſome meats tempts the <hi>appetite</hi> to deſire more than <hi>nature</hi> requires. So the <hi>quality</hi> oftentimes tempts and invites to an exceſs in <hi>quantity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The evil cuſtom of <hi>urging and importuning</hi> others to eat more than they have a deſire unto. This is many times a great cauſe of Gluttony. We are all more prone to exceed than to fall ſhort, and we need no incitation to eat, our <hi>own appetite</hi> is apt to incite us too much. But many people think it a piece of <hi>civility</hi> to <hi>urge, importune,</hi> and almoſt force their friends to eat, though they will not urge them, in the like kind to drink more than they have a mind unto. And ſo much of the cauſes of <hi>Gluttony.</hi>

                  </note> How hard ſoever it hath gone with ſome people in the World at ſome particular times, yet more have been killed by their own <hi>Gluttony</hi> than ever were ſtarved to death through want. It may well be ſuppoſed that a little more than <hi>half the quantity</hi> of meat and drink which many people take, would afford them as laſting and as healthful a ſtate of body as the over meaſure they ordinarily uſe. Intemperate men are <hi>Valetudinis ſuae proditores</hi> (as he ſaid) betrayers of their own health. For <hi>Gluttony</hi> though it kills not ſuddenly, yet it doth it ſurely and certainly like the <hi>Dropſie,</hi> of which 'tis ſaid, <hi>it killeth as it filleth,</hi> that is, <hi>by degrees and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly.

There are few diſeaſes but are the effects of <hi>Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> or <hi>exceſs</hi> in <hi>drinking;</hi> 'tis <hi>exceſs</hi> that commonly breeds them, and layes the matter and foundation of them.

               <p n="2">2. 'Tis a great enemy to the mind, and to all the exerciſes, operations and imployments of it, both <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>civil.</hi> It makes men <hi>heavy, drouſie, dull</hi> and <hi>ſhathfull.</hi> The <hi>body</hi> ought to be the inſtrument of the <hi>Soul</hi> in the ſervice of God.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Gluttony</hi> is a great <hi>ſymptom</hi> of a <hi>carnal mind,</hi> and a <hi>carnal mind is enmity againſt God,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. And that which oppoſes God is ſure to be deſtroy'd. And the ſpirit of God further aſſures us (at the thirteenth verſe of that Chapter, that <hi>they that live after the fleſh ſhall dye,</hi> and that not only a temporal <hi>death,</hi> (but except they be converted) an eternal death alſo.</p>

               <p n="6">6. 'Tis a moſt <hi>ungrateful</hi> ſin. It carries Gods good proviſions over to his <hi>enemy,</hi> even to the ſtrengthning of <hi>fleſhly luſts,</hi> and turneth them all againſt the giver of them. Is it not a horrible disingenuous thing ſo to provoke and diſhonour God with his own mercies? <hi>Pride, Idleneſs, fullneſs of Bread,</hi> and <hi>hard-heartedneſs to the poor</hi> were the <hi>provoking</hi> ſins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Ezek. 16 49.</p>
               <p n="7">7. 'Tis a kind of <hi>idolatry</hi> to mind the belly inordinately. The Apoſtle tells us of ſome, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. whoſe <hi>belly was their God.</hi> And ſuch perſons worſhip a <hi>craving</hi> God that will not let them alone except they ſerve him.</p>
               <p n="8">8. A <hi>gluttonous appetite</hi> maketh our very <hi>table become a ſnare to us,</hi> Deut. 6.11, 12. <hi>When thou haſt eaten and art full, then beware leſt thou forget thy God.</hi> How apt are people at a <hi>full table</hi> to offend with their teeth yea and with their tongues alſo.

               <p n="12">12. <hi>Gluttony</hi> is alwayes a great crime, but much more <hi>heinous</hi> in times of <hi>publick calamity,</hi> and when the people of God are under great afflictions.

               <p>Laſtly. The <hi>greatneſs</hi> of this ſin may appear in this, that it is ſo often and ſo frequently committed. Gods own people I ſuppoſe are not often tempted and overcome by <hi>drunkenneſs</hi> or <hi>uncleanneſs,</hi> but let them take heed of <hi>Gluttony.</hi> For this ſin is apt to ſteal upon people before they are aware. 'Tis a ſin that is apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate it felf with our appetite and deſire of eating for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our health. Our corrupt nature is as prone to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in this kind as any other, and therefore we had need be the more watchful againſt it. And ſo much of the great evil and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this Sin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I come now in the laſt place to preſcribe ſome, helps and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies againſt it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Look upon <hi>all your food</hi> as given you by God. Receive it as from <hi>his hand,</hi> and beg his bleſſing upon it. And remember the Apoſtles rule, <hi>whether ye eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> And if you have Gods glory in your eye, it will be a great means to keep you from <hi>intemperance</hi> in this kind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Labour to mortifie and ſubdue the <hi>irregular inclinations and deſires of the fleſh.</hi> What a horrible thing is it that a mans heart ſhould be ſet upon the pleaſing of his belly? They that are true Chriſtians ought to <hi>crucifie the fleſh with its affections and luſts.</hi>

               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:66289:157"/>
               <p n="3">3. Remember how the <hi>firſt ſin</hi> came into the World by eating. O ſin not as our firſt Parents did by an inordinate pleaſing of your appetite.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Check your <hi>appetite</hi> and reſolve, that ſhall not be ſatisfied to the <hi>full.</hi> Be <hi>affraid</hi> of ſinful exceſs. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome, <hi>Jude</hi> verſe. 12. that <hi>did eat without fear.</hi> A man that would be temperate <hi>in this kind,</hi> muſt be watchful over himſelf, and muſt exerciſe ſome authority over his appetite. For the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a <hi>Brute</hi> that commonly hath its ears ſtopt to <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Uſe all <hi>ſenſual delights</hi> in ſubſerviency unto as <hi>means</hi> to their right end, namely, to make you more thankful, more <hi>fit,</hi> and more <hi>chearful</hi> in the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Labour to underſtand well what is moſt conducing to <hi>your health,</hi> and let that be the <hi>ordinary rule and meaſure</hi> of your diet both for <hi>quantity</hi> and <hi>quality.</hi> Man in endued with <hi>reaſon</hi> as well as <hi>appetite;</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> if we will liſten to it, will tell us that our <hi>health</hi> is more to be regarded than our <hi>appetite.</hi> God alloweth us that which is moſt for our <hi>health,</hi> and forbiddeth us nothing but that which will hurt us. God would have us <hi>temperate,</hi> that a <hi>healthful body</hi> may be ſerviceable to our Souls in our <hi>Maſters</hi> work. The <hi>common rule</hi> that moſt people do go by in cating is their <hi>appetite.</hi> They think they muſt <hi>eat</hi> as they have <hi>appetite,</hi> and if they could eat more with an appetite and not be ſick after it, they think they have not been guilty of Gluttony and exceſs. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (who is not only a learned Divine but a skilful <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian</hi> alſo) writing about this ſin of <hi>Gluttony</hi> and the frequency of it [in his <hi>caſes of conſcience</hi> pag. 378.] Conjectures that moſt ſorts of people do uſually offend herein, and that <hi>particularly labouring</hi> people do ordinarily eat near a fourth part more than they need; that <hi>Shop-keepers,</hi> and perſons of eaſier Trades near a third part; that <hi>voluptuous Gentlemen</hi> and their attendants do often exceed near half; and that the <hi>children</hi> of ſuch Parents as govern not their appetites (but let them eat and drink as often and as much as they will) do uſually exceed above half, and thereby lay the foundation of the miſeries and diſeaſes of their whole life after. And therefore he judges that <hi>children</hi> ſhould be taught betimes <hi>ſome common and neceſſary precepts</hi> about <hi>their diet,</hi> and what tends to <hi>health</hi> and <hi>prolonging</hi> their life, and what to ſickneſs and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:66289:157"/> death; and that <hi>theſe principles</hi> ſhould be <hi>inſtilled</hi> into them with other moral precepts, in the books that they firſt learn. For 'tis certain that none love ſickneſs and death, but all love health and life. And therefore thoſe whom the fear of God doth not reſtrain from this kind of exceſs, may poſſibly be reſtrained from it through the fear of ſickneſs and death. But alaſs! few <hi>grown people,</hi> much leſs <hi>children,</hi> have any conſiderable knowledge what <hi>meaſure</hi> is beſt for them to uſe, but the <hi>common</hi> though <hi>deceitful rule</hi> they go by, is their appetite.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Sit not too long at meals. For by that means people are tempted to eat a little and a little more, and ſo at laſt they fall into exceſs.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Do not <hi>over perſwade and importune</hi> others to eat more than they have a mind to, notwithſtanding it is counted ſo great a piece of <hi>civility</hi> ſo to do. We think them highly <hi>culpable</hi> who urge people to <hi>drink more</hi> than is fit for them, why then ſhould we tempt people to <hi>eat more</hi> than they judge conducing to their health?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Look upon the practice of the <hi>ancient Chriſtians,</hi> thoſe great <hi>patterns</hi> of <hi>Abſtinence.</hi> They were much in <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> and ſtrangers to <hi>Gluttony</hi> and <hi>exceſs.</hi> Nay among the <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelves we may find ſome <hi>great examples</hi> of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in this kind. We read of the <hi>Platonick Suppers</hi> that were <hi>frugal and learned.</hi> They cared not ſo much to fill the bellies as the minds of their <hi>Gueſts.</hi> Their <hi>meat</hi> was <hi>good</hi> and <hi>ſufficient</hi> but their <hi>diſcourſe better.</hi> We read alſo what <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid to his friends at his moderate Supper, <hi>If ye be vertuous this will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? If ye be not, ye are not worthy of this?</hi> And we read of ſome <hi>famous men</hi> of old who to divert and keep them from <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance in this kind,</hi> uſed to have ſome <hi>good Book</hi> read to them at their Tables, that <hi>minding what was read</hi> might make them leſs mind their appetite. This is reported particularly of <hi>Pomponius At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> and <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> and this cuſtome came afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Colledges</hi> and <hi>Religious houſes,</hi> and is obſerved in ſome of them at this day.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Go ſometime into the houſes of the <hi>Poor,</hi> and ſee what <hi>mean</hi> ſare and <hi>proviſions</hi> they live upon.

Drunkenneſs</hi> doth uſually more <hi>brutifie</hi> a man, and make him more like a <hi>beaſt,</hi> than exceſs in eating doth, and ſo is a more <hi>ſcandalous ſin.</hi> And therefore humane Laws have provided a penalty againſt <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> but not againſt <hi>Gluttony.</hi> Now <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> in the <hi>largeſt ſence</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth both to the <hi>affection</hi> and to the <hi>effect.</hi> He is a <hi>Drunkard reputatively</hi> and in the ſight of God; who would drink to exceſs if he had it, and would lie at the <hi>Ale-houſe</hi> or <hi>Tavern,</hi> and drink as others do, but cannot by reaſon of his want of money; ſo that he is not reſtrained by his will,<note n="*" place="margin">Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas eſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, nihil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liud ſumus niſi volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</hi>
                  </note> but by his <hi>neceſſity.</hi> And further, you muſt obſerve that 'tis not only the <hi>higheſt degree</hi> of drunkenneſs that is to be called by <hi>that name,</hi> but <hi>lower degrees</hi> of it alſo that diſturb and diſorder the <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>underſtanding</hi> of a man, may juſtly ſo be called.

Some men that can bear <hi>much drink</hi> without <hi>intoxication</hi> may be more guilty (in the ſight of God) of <hi>exceſs</hi> than others, who by a <hi>ſmall quantity</hi> upon a <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize</hi> are drunk before they are aware. He that hath by drinking <hi>diſturbed his reaſon,</hi> and <hi>diſabled</hi> and <hi>hindred</hi> it from the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of its proper work and office, is drunken in ſome degree; But he that hath <hi>quite diſabled it,</hi> is <hi>ſtark drunk.</hi> I know it will here be ſaid that a <hi>glaſs of wine</hi> or <hi>ſtrong beer</hi> moderately taken is many times very uſeful to give a man an <hi>aſſiſtant alacrity</hi> in his <hi>work</hi> and <hi>duty,</hi> and the ſervice God requires of him. No doubt a man may lawfully add the <hi>refocillation, refreſhment</hi> and <hi>alacrity</hi> to his Spirits which maketh him more ready and chearful in the duties of his general or particular calling. But the <hi>exceſs</hi> is that which we here ſpeak againſt, as <hi>that</hi> which is alwayes to be avoided And ſo much of the <hi>firſt particular</hi> what <hi>drunkenneſs is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We come now to inquire into the <hi>cauſes</hi> of drunkenneſs. And we ſhall find there are <hi>many cauſes</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. Love of <hi>good fellowſhip</hi> (as they call it) and <hi>merry compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> where they drive away <hi>all thoughts</hi> that favour of ſound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the <hi>fear of God, or care of their Souls.</hi> They love ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany where they may talk their pleaſure over their cups, and may laugh and ſcoff at thoſe that are ſeriouſly Religious and dare not do as they do But alaſs! the end of ſuch mirth what is it but heavineſs and grief and <hi>vexation of ſpirit.</hi> Poor Wretches! Is this the merriment you ſo much covet and delight in? keep it to

Were I your <hi>enemy,</hi> I would not wiſh you ſo much harm and miſery as you voluntarily chooſe for your ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Slight thoughts of this ſin,</hi> not conſidering that 'tis one of the <hi>black liſt</hi> which excludes out of Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither Fornicators nor Idolaters, nor Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, nor Effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding this <hi>dreadful ſentence</hi> denounced by God in his holy word againſt this ſin, there are ſome ſo <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>miſerably depraved,</hi> as to think it a piece of bravery to drink ſtoutly and a ſign of a <hi>ſtrong brain</hi> to be able to bear much drink, and a great <hi>conqueſt</hi> over another man to drink him <hi>down,</hi> not conſidering in the mean time that while they conquer others in this vile manner <hi>at their Cups,</hi> they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſhamefully conquered and overcome by the Devil.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Not conſidering nor underſtanding the extreme hurt that <hi>this kind of exceſs</hi> does unto their bodies. They apprehend not how much it ſpoils the <hi>temper</hi> of their <hi>ſtomachs,</hi> ruines their <hi>health,</hi> and ordinarily ſhortens their lives.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="6">6. Another very frequent cauſe of drunkenneſs is that vile cuſtome of <hi>drinking Healths</hi> and <hi>conſtraining others to pledge them,</hi> which conſtrains many a man to drink more than he ſhould. There are many <hi>reaſons</hi> may be alledged againſt this <hi>evil cuſtome.</hi> (1.) To urge a <hi>Health</hi> is a great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable <hi>uſurpation</hi>

                  </gap>, which it muſt needs be if he may compell me to drink <hi>ſo much</hi> as will deſtroy my health, as is frequently done. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have gotten a great fit of ſickneſs (and <hi>ſome</hi> their <hi>death</hi>) by one drunken bout? And beſides, If I to comply with anothers <hi>drunken humor</hi> (who begins an health) ſhould drink <hi>ſo much</hi> as to make may ſelf ſick, beſure he will neither feel my <hi>pains</hi> nor pay my <hi>Phyſician</hi> nor anſwer to God for my ſin. (3.) We ought not to incourage others to drink <hi>more than is fit,</hi> as the cuſtom of <hi>pledging Healths</hi> manifeſtly does. Poſſibly another would not have pledged the healths that went about if he had ſeen me <hi>ſtick</hi> at it, and not to have done it <hi>before him.</hi> My <hi>example</hi> may in all likelihood have induced him the <hi>rather</hi> to do it. And why ſhould I be acceſſary to draw another man into intemperance? And poſſibly had I ſtoutly refuſed it, it might have prevented the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of any more <hi>healths</hi> at that time, and ſo I might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a great deal of evil. And further, why ſhould I encourage ſuch a <hi>vile cuſtome</hi> as makes it a <hi>crime</hi> and an <hi>high offence</hi> againſt <hi>civility</hi> and <hi>good manners</hi> to refuſe a health, when I have <hi>ſo much reaſon</hi> to do it. Surely all <hi>manifeſt occaſions and provocations</hi> to ſin ought to be avoided, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reprove them.</hi> 'Tis notoriouſly known that <hi>healthing</hi> is a frequent occaſion of <hi>drunkenneſs,</hi> and not of that only, but of <hi>quarrelling, fighting</hi> and ſometimes of <hi>murder</hi> alſo. And why ſhould I encourage <hi>ſuch a cuſtome</hi> which is the occaſion of ſo much miſchief? I do not ſay 'tis <hi>ſimply evil</hi> in it ſelf to drink a <hi>glaſs of wine,</hi> or keep <hi>off my hat</hi> whilſt <hi>another is remembred.</hi> But <hi>by accident</hi> it may be <hi>evil,</hi> namely, if I thereby encourage an <hi>evil cuſtom</hi> (which is a great occaſion of drunkenneſs) and give <hi>ſcandal</hi> and <hi>offence</hi> to ſuch who (upon <hi>that account</hi>) have a great averſation to it. Yet ſo it may happen that this accident may be <hi>outweighed</hi> and <hi>overballanced</hi> by a <hi>greater accident,</hi> namely, if I ſee <hi>my life</hi> in apparant danger if I refuſe it. And any <hi>other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> which will really out-weigh the <hi>former hurtful accident</hi> may
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:66289:160"/> make it lawful. As in ſome caſes and companies the offence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by denying it may poſſibly be ſuch as will do more hurt far than the yielding, to it would do. As in that caſe when a mans loyalty to the King is laid upon it, (though I confeſs it is a very unreaſonable thing to make that a <hi>Teſt of Loyalty</hi> which many <hi>good men</hi> and very faithful and loyal to the King do <hi>ſcruple,</hi> and which his <hi>Majeſty</hi> himſelf in his <hi>firſt Proclamation</hi> after his return declared againſt) yet (I ſay) if ſuch a thing ſhould happen, then <hi>Chriſtian Prudence</hi> muſt be the <hi>preſent decider of the caſe,</hi> by conſidering whether more good or evil be like to enſue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and muſt determine accordingly. To be bare when others lay the honour of our <hi>ſuperiors</hi> upon it, is a <hi>ceremony</hi> which on the <hi>foreſaid reaſons</hi> may be complied with. But when to avoid <hi>a greater evil,</hi> we are extraordinarily put on any ſuch <hi>ceremony,</hi> 'tis fit we ſhould add ſome <hi>ſuch words</hi> as may declare <hi>upon what account</hi> we do it, that ſo we may prevent <hi>ſcandal</hi> and <hi>offence.</hi> But the <hi>beſt way of all</hi> is to avoid (as much as poſſibly we can) ſuch <hi>company</hi> as are like to put us upon theſe <hi>ſcruples</hi> and <hi>inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> And ſo much of the <hi>cauſes</hi> of drunkenneſs.</p>

Being once invited to dinner by a friend of his, in his way thither he called at a houſe where (as it happened) there was that day a <hi>Wedding.</hi> Being courteouſly invited to come in, he found the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in a very <hi>gay humor,</hi> full of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>kindneſs</hi> one to another, and careſſing one another in the moſt <hi>obliging</hi> manner.

In the evening (calling again at
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:66289:162"/> at the ſame houſe in his return) and expecting to find the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>kindneſs</hi> he had before obſerved to be augmented; quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he found the houſe full of broils and noiſe, full of fighting, quarrelling and all confuſion. The gueſts inſtead of imbracing were now throwing the Pots at one anothers heads. This he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving to be the effect of the wine taken in exceſs, he changed his former bleſſing into a curſe, and for ever after made it <hi>Haram</hi> or a curſed thing for any of his Diſciples to drink wine. But <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhould have conſidered that <hi>ab abuti ad non uti, non valet conſequentia.</hi> The <hi>abuſe</hi> of a <hi>lawful thing</hi> is no good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt the uſe of it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Conſider what a dreadful wo is denounced againſt ſuch perſons as purpoſely and deſignedly ſtrive to make others drunk?

               <p n="12">12. Conſider that drunkenneſs is often attended with dreadful judgments in this life. We read that <hi>Amnon</hi> was murdered by his Brother <hi>Abſaloms</hi> command, when <hi>his heart was merry with wine.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. They will pretend that drinking and company-keeping maintains kindneſs and friendſhip and love among neighbours. To this I anſwer, can any rational man imagine that the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſtroy the ſoul, the body, the eſtate, the good-name, the family of their neighbour is any argument of kindneſs to him? Surely ſuch perſons as draw one another into ſuch courſes are the greateſt enemies to one another imaginable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They will alledge that thoſe holy men <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> fell into this ſin. I anſwer, <hi>Noah</hi> fell into it but once, and that (as it ſeems) upon ignorance and ſurprize, not knowing at firſt the property, quality and operation of the wine,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.20.21.</note> which was the fruit of the Vineyard he himſelf had planted. And poſſibly he was the more eaſily overtaken, as being over-joyed when he taſted ſuch excellent fruits of his own labours, and allowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a little more freedom in drinking thereof than (in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) he would have done, had he known the power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the wine. And accordingly we do not find that he was ever overtaken ſo again. As for <hi>Lot</hi> indeed we read that he was twice overtaken, but both times by the perſwaſion of his own Daughters<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.33.35.</note> to which he was (poſſibly) the more ready to give ear, becauſe their hearts being oppreſſed with grief for the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the loſs of their goods and ſudden death of his wife, he thought they might take a little more liberty in the uſe of wine at that time for their comfort and refreſhment, and ſupporting their ſpirits under ſuch great and ſore afflictions. And we know that they that venture to go near the brink do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:66289:164"/> fall into the water. So that however thoſe holy men were overtaken once or twice, yet they were no drunkards. They fell into this ſin by ſurprize; it was not their uſual practice. And theſe examples no more juſtify thoſe who live in this vice than <hi>Peters</hi> once denying his Lord and Maſter excuſeth thoſe who make a total and final Apoſtacy from him. The ſpirit of God hath purpoſely recorded the<note n="*" place="margin">Sunt <hi>cavendi,</hi> non <hi>caden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di</hi> exempla</note> ſlips of theſe holy men, to ſhew us how frail our nature is, and to caution us not to preſume upon our own ſtrength, but to be the more watchful; and alſo to ſhew us that they who fall through infirmity into the like ſins, ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of Gods mercy in Chriſt, if they ſeriouſly repent of them and forſake them. No <hi>Pilot</hi> in his wits when he ſees Sea-marks purpoſely ſet up to give warning of rocks, ſands, or ſhelves (upon which others have made Ship-wrack) will take occaſion thereby to run his Ship upon them, but rather will imploy all his care and skill to avoid them, that he may eſcape the like dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And this is the uſe we ſhould make of theſe examples.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They ſay they do it to drive away care and trouble of mind and melancholy. For anſwer to this, I deſire firſt to know what cares and troubles they are they deſire thus to drive away. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they are ſome checks and rebukes of their conſciciences for their ſins. If ſo, they may poſſibly by ſuch divertiſements ſtop the mouths of their conſciences for the preſent, but they will roar louder upon them hereafter. It were a thouſand times better for them to go alone than into ſuch wild company, and to think ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly of their condition, and of their miſery, and the true way of coming out of it. To go into merry and vain company is but a bad remedy to drive away melancholy or to ſtop the mouth of an accuſing conſcience. We may ſay to ſuch perſons, as <hi>Solomon</hi> does <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I ſaid of laughter it is mad, and of mirth what doth it?</hi> And Chap. 7. Verſe 4. <hi>The heart of the wiſe man is in the houſe of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the houſe mirth.</hi> If we ſaw a mad man whoop and hollow and make a great noiſe, we ſhould not envy but pity ſuch mirth. The vain and fooliſh merriment of wicked company is that which a ſober and ſerious mind can never be pleaſed with. And therefore they that ſeek ſuch company to divert and drive away their melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, take the direct way to increaſe it. Now melancholy is of two ſorts, either ſuch as ariſes from the mind or ſuch as ariſes
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:66289:164"/> from the body. As for that which ariſes from the mind, the beſt way to drive it away is to clear the Soul of all guilt by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and flying to the blood of Chriſt for pardon. For they <hi>are happy</hi> (and they only) <hi>whoſe ſins are forgiven and whoſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are covered, and to whom God will not impute tranſgreſſion.</hi> Secret and fervent prayer alſo to God (which gives vent to the mind and ſo eaſes it) is an excellent remedy in this caſe. To which I may add the imparting the troubles of our mind (if they be urgent) to ſome wiſe and faithful friend, and craving his advice and counſel as a good way and means alſo to obtain eaſe. But if the <hi>Melancholy</hi> ariſe from the body by reaſon of darkſome fumes and vapors it caſts up into the mind, ſome proper Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is then requiſite, and the moderate uſe of ſuch things as may <hi>exhilerate the ſpirits.</hi> Yea, <hi>buſineſs and imployment is a great remedy</hi> in this caſe. For <hi>ſtanding waters ſtagnate</hi> and gather <hi>mud,</hi> whereas <hi>running waters</hi> are clear and ſweet. <hi>Good company</hi> alſo (I mean of <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>ſober</hi> Chriſtians) is a great help againſt this malady. And ſtriving to be chearful (in an innocent and inoffenſive manner, that our pectorals may be ſhaken and fumes diſperſed) is of great uſe likewiſe. But as for going to the <hi>Ale-houſe</hi> or <hi>Tavern</hi> (and conſorting with ſuch company as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally frequent thoſe places) in my opinion it is far from being a proper remedy for Melancholy, but ordinarily does more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it, eſpecially when people come to reflect how greatly God has been diſhonoured and their ſouls hurt by ſuch meetings.</p>

Are you ſo near Eternity, and know not how better to improve your time? Can you ſit tipling and prating away your precious time over your Pots, when the mudwalls of your bodies are daily crumbling down, and when you know not how ſoon you may be ſummoned to appear before Gods dreadful Tribunal? But it may be you will ſay you are <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and ſo have more time and leiſure at your own diſpoſal than other men have, who muſt earn their bread before they eat it. But hark you in your ears. Where there is much leiſure from worldly buſineſs, God expects more time ſhould be ſpent and imployed on the ſoul, and not ſpent in idle merriment and ſinful jollity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some will pretend their heads are very weak and a little overturns them, and ſo they hope they are the more excuſable. I
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:66289:165"/> anſwer, they that know their own weakneſs ſhould be more eſpecially watchful over themſelves, and take heed of ſuch liquors, and ſuch company that may endanger them. If you know that leſs poiſon will kill you than another man, you ſhould be the more fearful of it, and ſhun it with greater care, and not with a fool-hardineſs encourage your ſelf to take it. And ſo you ſhould do in this caſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Others will ſay, that though they drink much, yet they can <hi>bear it well away,</hi> their heads are ſtrong, they ſeldom are drunk. I would adviſe ſuch perſons ſeriouſly to conſider of that place before-mentioned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Wo unto them that are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to drink wine, and men of ſtrength to mingle ſtrong drink.</hi> Let ſuch <hi>ſtrong-braind drunkards</hi> conſider what the prudent Lord <hi>Burley</hi> ſaid in his advice to his Son. That <hi>to carry much drink is a commendation fitter for a Brewers horſe than for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Some will ſay, They ſhall be jeer'd and laugh'd at, if they ſhould be ſo preciſe as not to do as others do. I would adviſe ſuch perſons to conſider what the Apoſtle ſayes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. <hi>If ye be reproached for the name of Chriſt happy are ye.</hi> To be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for obedience to any of Chriſts commands is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for his name. And ſhall the reproaches of vile and wicked men more terrifie us than the wrath and diſpleaſure of God? A good name indeed is highly to be valued. But is that a good name to be commended and praiſed by drunkards and ſuch leud livers? A good name is to be well-reported of among wiſe and good men. Therefore if you fear reproach, fear drunkenneſs and avoid company-keeping which will make you hear ill among ſuch as are wiſe and ſober. Remember what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and ſinful generation, of him ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy Angels.</hi> I ſuppoſe there are none but would be glad to be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt at that day. Therefore let us not be aſhamed to own his wayes, and to own our ſelves for his Diſciples here. And ſo much by way of anſwer to the vain pretences and excuſes that people make for continuing in this ſin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I come now in the laſt place to give ſome remedies and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections againſt this vice.</p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:66289:165"/>
               <p n="1">1. If thou haſt before been guilty of this ſin, humble thy ſoul to God by deep and ſerious repentance, and flie to the blood of Chriſt for thy pardon. True repentance for ſins paſt, is a good means to preſerve us from them for the time to come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If thou findeſt company-keeping to be a ſtrong temptation to thee, earneſtly beg grace of God to help thee to reſiſt that temptation, and to keep thee from delighting in ſuch company among whom thy ſoul is in ſo much danger.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Awaken thy reaſon and underſtanding to conſider of the manifold evils of this ſin. Ask thy ſelf whether the diſpleaſure of God, the brutifying thy ſelf, the blotting thy name, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of thy eſtate, the deſtroying of thy health, the corrupting of thy Family, the damning of thy Soul are not things that ought to be conſidered of by thee? Weigh in the ballance of reaſon how much the joyes of a good conſcience and the favour of God out-weigh the ſottiſh mirth of good-fellows.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Shun the occaſions of this vice and (as much as thou canſt) keep off from the places and houſes where ſuch drinking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions uſe to meet. Be not their companion in ſin, leſt thou be their companion in hell. Declare thy fixed reſolution (by the aſſiſtance of Grace) of living ſoberly, that ſo thy old compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be diſcouraged from aſſaulting or tempting of thee at any time. Never mind either the perſwaſions or reproaches of ſuch vile and profligate perſons.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Send to thy former drinking companions and adviſe them to leave off thoſe evil wayes. Think with thy ſelf how <hi>bleſſed a thing it is to convert a ſinner from the error of his way,</hi> and <hi>to ſave a ſoul from death and eternal miſery.</hi> Regard not their frowns or ſcorns or reproaches, but labour to do them good even againſt their wills, and thy reward will be with the Lord.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Think how much more joy and comfort there is in ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety than there can be in drunkenneſs. Conſider with thy ſelf whether ſober and temperate perſons do not live not only an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſter and ſafer, but a more comfortable and pleaſing life than Drunkards do? They have none of thoſe ſour belchings and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, none of that <hi>preternatural thirſt</hi> and eager deſire after drink that drunkards have. Certainly drunkenneſs carrieth its own puniſhment with it, and temperance its joy and comfort.</p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:66289:166"/>
               <p n="7">7. Conſider what a ſtrange difference there is between a ſober man and a drunkard. Look upon a ſober man, how calm is his mind? how wiſe are his words? how regular and amiable is his converſation? how is he reverenced and reſpected by all that are wiſe and ſcrious? Then look upon a drunkard, how ugly and ill favoured a creature is he, and how unlike a man of reaſon and underſtanding? O wholſome Temperance! how much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter art thou than loathſom debauchery? what a lovelineſs and beauty is there in ſobriety? how ſweetly doth a ſober man enjoy himſelf? how is he honoured and eſteemed by others? whereas a drunkard is the mark of common obloquie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Think of that cup of trembling that ſhall be put into the hands of drunkards to drink hereafter. Conſider how drunkards for their full cups here muſt drink the <hi>Cup of Gods wrath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed</hi> in the other life, and for their ſhort pleaſures here muſt looſe the pleaſures <hi>that are at Gods right hand for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Underſtand well thy own meaſure, and let no man force thee to exceed it. Think of that excellent advice of the learned and pious Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> in his Church-Porch.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of Uncleanneſs.</head>
               <p>THE Nature of man is ſo vile and corrupt and ſo prone to this ſin of Uncleanneſs, that we had need uſe all care and caution leſt while we are writing againſt it, and endeavouring to beat it down, we ſhould any way ſtir it up and excite it. In treating therefore of this Subject, I ſhall proceed in this method.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſhew the <hi>odiouſneſs</hi> and <hi>heinouſneſs</hi> of this ſin, and what <hi>great reaſons</hi> we have to abhor it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Shall anſwer the <hi>vain excuſes</hi> that men who are addicted to this ſin do uſually make for themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Shall give ſome directions and preſcribe ſome remedies againſt it.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Fitſt.</hi> The <hi>Odiouſneſs</hi> and <hi>heinouſneſs</hi> of this ſin may appear to us, if we conſider how ſtrictly God hath forbidden it in his holy word, and how ſeverely he hath declared his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt it. And that man that is not awed by the declared will of his Creator, I know not what will awe him. 'Tis in vain to think to convince a man of the evil and danger of any ſin by other arguments, whom the expreſs word and declared will of God cannot convince. I ſhall therefore ſet before you what God both in the old and new Teſtament declares concerning this ſin, and then leave every one to judge whether it be not our duty to abhor it, and with all care and conſcience to keep our ſelves from it. Read therefore and well conſider theſe following Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.3. <hi>And God came to</hi> Abimelech <hi>in a dream by night, and ſaid to him, behold, thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou haſt taken, for ſhe is a mans wife.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Gen. 38.24. <hi>And it came to paſs about three moneths after, that it was told Judah, ſaying,</hi> Tamar <hi>thy daughter in law hath plaid the Harlot, and alſo behold ſhe is with child by whoredom; and Judah ſaid, bring her forth and let her be burnt.</hi>

Many great and potent men are oftentimes guilty of this ſin, whom ordinary Magiſtrates either cannot or dare not, or (through remiſneſs) will not meddle with.

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:66289:171"/> without the the body (as the drunkard doth wine) but this ſin hurteth and abuſeth the body it ſelf in a more remarkable manner by an intemperate and exceſſive exhauſting the vital ſpirits, and conſuming the natural heat and moiſture, which are the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of health, ſtrength, and life. And beſides, this ſin is frequently attended with that loathſom diſeaſe which makes the committers of it to rot and ſtink above ground. So that if there be any men ſo ſottiſh as not to fear Hell or puniſhment in another life; yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks they ſhould reſolve to live chaſtly for fear of rotting their bodies by uncleanneſs, and ſo ſhortning this life wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect all their happineſs. The Apoſtle indeed in that Chapter before-mentioned uſes another argument of another nature to true believers why they ſhould keep themſelves from uncleanneſs. Verſe 15. <hi>Know you not</hi> (ſayes he) that <hi>your bodies are the members of Chriſt, and will you take the members of Chriſt and make them the members of an Harlot? God forbid.</hi> For as wedlock makes man and wife one body lawfully, ſo fornication makes the fornicator and the harlot one body unlawfully. Further, he ſhews that the bodies of true believers are Temples of the Holy Ghoſt (who is freely given of God to dwell in them) and therefore their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ought to be kept pure and undefiled. The Apoſtle therefore in this place uſes theſe arguments to true believers and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure <hi>Fornicators.</hi> For their bodies are not members of Chriſt nor Temples of the Holy Ghoſt. But it ſeems ſome filthy <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> in that time went about to perſwade thoſe Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth</hi> that fornication was no ſin, or at leaſt no great ſin, and the Apoſtle levels his arguments againſt ſuch wicked ſuggeſtions as theſe.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Adulterers and Adultereſſes violate the ſacred ordinance of marriage and the ſolemn covenant they made before God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their friends as witneſſes.

And therefore Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in either party is the moſt abominable breach of faith that can be imagined, and they that are guilty of it, what can they expect but vengeance from God?</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Adulterer highly ſinneth againſt him whoſe wife he defileth. He robs him of the heart-love and affection of his wife which is an irreparable injury. Beſides, he brings an odious

               <p n="13">13. By the Law of God Adultery was to be puniſhed with death, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.22. And whereas other crimes were not capital nor to be puniſhed with death except proved by two or three witneſſes, God permitted the jealous husband to make a ſpecial trial of his wifes chaſtity and honeſty, and gave him an extraordinary way and means for convicting of her (if ſhe were guilty) when no witneſſes could poſſibly be produced againſt her, namely, ſhe was to drink of the water of jealouſie which if ſhe were innocent did not hurt her at all, but rather did her good and made her fruitful. But if ſhe were guilty, then upon <hi>drinking thereof her belly ſhould ſwell</hi> and <hi>her thigh rot,</hi> and ſo the woman ſhould be accurſed among her people. So that rather than God would have this heinous ſin of adultery go unpuniſhed, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf appointed an extraordinary way for the diſcovery of it. Nay before this law was given (it ſeems) it was in uſe among Gods own people to puniſh adultery with death. For <hi>Judah</hi> adjudged <hi>Tamar</hi> his daughter in law to be burnt for this ſin, as appears, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.24.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The very <hi>Heathens</hi> by the <hi>light of nature</hi> adjudged <hi>adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to be a capital crime and to deſerve death.

For beſides the bitterneſs that his Soul was in for it, his Son <hi>Abſolom</hi> rebelled againſt him, drove him out of his Kingdom, and openly defiled his wives. And this ſin is left as a perpetual blot upon his name and memory. As for <hi>Solomon,</hi> his ſin was ſo great that it almoſt ruined him and his Kingdom.

But <hi>our Saviour</hi> himſelf refuſed to <hi>condemn her,</hi> becauſe he came not into the world to execute the office of an earthly judge, but of a <hi>mediator</hi> who was to procure the pardon of our ſins through his <hi>merits and interceſſion.</hi> He came not to <hi>condemn</hi> but to <hi>ſave,</hi> and to <hi>give his life a ranſom for many.</hi> And therefore he would not execute the office of a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> in adjudging her to death, but of a <hi>Miniſter</hi> in calling her to <hi>repentance</hi> and amendment of her life.

And 'tis no wonder that they are ſo much frequented. For as 'twas obſerved by the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of old, many turned from other Sects to the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> but ſcarce any from the <hi>Epicureans</hi> to other ſorts.

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:66289:174"/> only this, I never knew any get good by frequenting of them, I believe many have got a great deal of hurt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Laſcivious books,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>Play-books, Romances, amorous Poems</hi> and <hi>Sonnets;</hi> ſuch books as theſe certainly do a great deal of hurt, eſpecially to the youth of the Nation. If one great remedy (as I have ſhewed before) againſt <hi>all ſorts</hi> of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be the preſerving of our thoughts (as much as poſſibly we can) from <hi>all unclean imaginations</hi> and <hi>phanſies,</hi> ſurely <hi>thoſe books</hi> that ſuggeſt <hi>ugly</hi> and <hi>immoral</hi> things to the mind (as amorous books uſually do) muſt needs be <hi>great depravers of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> and <hi>great teachers of vice and immorality.</hi> And they that deſire in <hi>ſuch arguments</hi> to ſhew their <hi>wit</hi> to the <hi>poiſoning of the minds of men,</hi> do therein declare that they want very much the <hi>true wiſdom</hi> which would teach them better things. There is indeed a kind of <hi>ſcurrilous</hi> and <hi>obſcene wit</hi> that makes <hi>fools</hi> laugh, but <hi>wiſe men</hi> frown. And <hi>they</hi> that love to have their <hi>ſenſuality</hi> tickled and excited, delight in <hi>ſuch things</hi> and in <hi>ſuch Books.</hi> There is a <hi>grave Author</hi> who has this conceit concerning <hi>good men</hi> who <hi>write</hi> and <hi>leave good books to the world</hi> that inſtruct it in <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> namely, that as their books (after their deceaſe) do <hi>good</hi> and turn men to <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> ſo their joyes in heaven ſhall be encreaſed. And contrarily, that <hi>wicked men</hi> who write, and leave ſuch books to the World which corrupt it with <hi>error</hi> and <hi>immorality,</hi> as <hi>their books</hi> do hurt and miſchief, (after their deceaſe) ſo their <hi>torments</hi> in hell (they dying im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitently) ſhall be increaſed.

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Laſcivious Pictures,</hi> which are dangerous <hi>provocations</hi> and <hi>incentives</hi> to Luſt.

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Laſcivious dreſſes. A modeſt and comely adornment of the body</hi> does very much declare the <hi>modeſty</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> of the mind.

               <p n="6">6. Shall give ſome <hi>directions</hi> and <hi>means</hi> for the attaining of it.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Firſt. Diſcontent</hi> is an <hi>unquiet frame</hi> of heart under our preſent condition, and expreſſes it ſelf in <hi>murmuring</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining thereat.</hi> For commonly <hi>inward vexing and repining,</hi> and <hi>outward complaining</hi> and murmuring go together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>great ſinfulneſs</hi> of it may appear to us in theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis a <hi>quarrelling the wiſdom</hi> of God, and a ſecret <hi>accuſing</hi> and taxing his <hi>Providence,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Non ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicandum de provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina ante quintum actum.</note> as if he did not wiſely order the <hi>Lots</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> of his People. Holy <hi>Job</hi> under his great afflictions was far from this temper; For though he ſuffered ſo deeply, yet he charged not God with folly in that ſevere diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation towards him. But ſaid, <hi>the Lord giveth and the Lord ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord,</hi> Job 1.21, 22.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis a quarrelling his <hi>Fatherly care over us,</hi> as if he had not any love or affection to us or any regard of us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis a quarrelling his <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> as if he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the <hi>many gracious promiſes</hi> he has made for our good.</p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:66289:176"/>
               <p n="4">4. 'Tis a ſecret accuſing of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as if he dealt hardly with us, and puniſhed us more than our ſins deſerved.<note n="*" place="margin">Qui in poenis mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientis juſtitiam accuſat.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. 'Tis a <hi>carriage</hi> very unworthy of the <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>expectation</hi> of a Chriſtian. He that hath his <hi>Peace</hi> made with God in Chriſt, and a title to an heavenly inheritance, ſhould endeavour from <hi>that conſideration</hi> to calm and compoſe his ſoul under his greateſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
               <p n="6">6. 'Tis unanſwerable to the <hi>experience</hi> we have had of Gods former gracious dealing with us, and helping of us out of <hi>ſtraits</hi> and difficulties.</p>
               <p n="7">7. 'Tis a great <hi>gratification</hi> to Satan. We cannot gratifie the <hi>Devil</hi> more (who is a Male-contented Spirit) than to murmur againſt our Creator. To be of a <hi>diſcontented unquiet Spirit</hi> is to be like the <hi>Devil.</hi> He is reſtleſs and unquiet, always in oppoſition to God, alwayes fretting at his diſpenſations.</p>
               <p n="8">8. 'Tis <hi>a betraying and expoſing us to great temptations.</hi> The Devil ſcarce ever has ſo great power over any as over thoſe <hi>that are diſcontented.</hi> Oh the <hi>direful things</hi> he draws ſuch perſons unto. My heart even akes when I think of them, and my hand is ready to tremble while I write of them. <hi>Some</hi> of them he draws to make a formal Covenant with himſelf. <hi>Others</hi> to <hi>do ſuch things</hi> againſt themſelves that even nature <hi>abhors.</hi> So that all that love themſelves ſhould beg of God to keep them, and ſhould watch over themſelves as to this particular ſin. For let them aſſure themſelves that nothing betrayes us ſooner into the <hi>Devils</hi> hands than diſcon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ent. It is a ſtock he uſes to graffe his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon. The Devil will deſire no greater advantage againſt a ſoul than to find it in ſuch a temper. He is never more buſie about any than ſuch perſons, and uſually makes dangerous uſe of the <hi>unquietneſs</hi> and <hi>repining</hi> of their ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="9">9. 'Tis ſuch a temper as exceedingly unfits us for holy duties and for the ſervice which otherwiſe we might do for God. And ſo much of the ſinfulneſs of Diſcontent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I come now in the <hi>third place</hi> to ſhew the folly of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>bootleſs.</hi> For as one of the <hi>Antients</hi> well ſaid, the <hi>miſeries</hi> and <hi>evils</hi> we <hi>ſuffer,</hi> and at which we are ſo apt to be vexed and troubled, are either ſuch as we can remedy or ſuch as we cannot remedy. If they be ſuch as we cannot remedy, then what a folly is it to vex and fret at them, ſeeing it is impoſſible
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:66289:177"/> to help them. Our Leſſon then is Patience and Submiſſion.<note n="*" place="margin">Levius fit patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere eſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fas.</note> But if the evils we ſuffer be ſuch as are remediable, then let us not vex or fret at them, but let us uſe all care and diligence to help our ſelves and to remedy them; And this is <hi>good advice,</hi> though given by a <hi>Heathen Philoſopher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It takes away the <hi>comfort</hi> of what we enjoy. If a man enjoyes a thouſand mercies (in which he ought to rejoyce, and for which he ought to be thankfull) yet if his mind be <hi>diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented</hi> they will all ſeem as nothing to him. So that no one thing bereaves a man more of the comfort he might enjoy in his life than diſcontent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It makes our afflictions worſe: A diſcontented perſon is like a man in a feaver, that by his toſſing and tumbling more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes his heat; Or like a <hi>Bird in the lime-twigs</hi> which the more it flutters the more it intangles it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It provokes God oftentimes to ſend new and more afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon us. What did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> get by mumuring in the Wilderneſs but a longer ſtay in the Wilderneſs. Children that <hi>ſob</hi> and are <hi>ſtomachful</hi> after <hi>whipping</hi> commonly get another ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whipping for their pains.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It makes a mans life very uneaſie both to himſelf and his relations and to all that are about him. No body cares to be near ſuch perſons as are alwayes <hi>murmuring</hi> and <hi>complaining.</hi> And ſo much of this folly of Diſcontent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I come now in the fourth place to ſhew what <hi>Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is,</hi> and wherein the nature of it conſiſts.</p>
               <p>'Tis a <hi>ſweet quiet gracious frame of Spirit</hi> freely ſubmitting to Gods <hi>alwiſe and fatherly diſpoſal</hi> of us in every condition. There are <hi>ſome things</hi> that <hi>this gracious frame</hi> may conſiſt with, and ſome things that are oppoſite to it. (1.) It may conſiſt with a <hi>due ſenſibleneſs</hi> of Gods hand in afflicting of us. 'Tis not a <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical apathy</hi> or <hi>inſenſibility.</hi> The Apoſtle gives us an excellent Rule (taken out of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 3.11.) how we ſhould carry our ſelves under afflictions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. <hi>My Son deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.</hi> Some bold and ſecure ſinners are apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and diſregard the correcting hand of God; the weaker ſort of Chriſtians are apt to ſink in ſpirit, and faint under their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Now the Apoſtle adviſes us to ſteer between theſe two,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:66289:177" rendition="simple:additions"/> namely, to be <hi>ſenſible of Gods hand when it is upon us,</hi> and yet <hi>not to faint</hi> or <hi>deſpond</hi> under it. (2.) It may conſiſt with an humble complaint to God or man. We may groan under our Afflictions but we ought not to grumble. (3.) It may conſiſt with ſeeking out for help and eaſe in a lawful way. For that is our duty and God expects it from us. But now the things oppoſite to it are. (1.) <hi>Inward fretting, vexing,</hi> and <hi>tumultuation of ſpirit,</hi> and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the heart againſt the Almighty. (2.) <hi>Sinking of Spirit</hi> deſponding and deſpairing of help. (3.) <hi>Outward murmuring</hi> complaining and repining. (4.) <hi>Sinful ſhifts</hi> to help our ſelves. And ſo much of the <hi>nature of true Chriſtian contentment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. I come now to ſhew the <hi>amiableneſs</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> of this frame of Spirit.</p>

True <hi>Chriſtian contentment</hi> is not a <hi>ſingle grace</hi> but a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation,</hi> a <hi>cluſter</hi> of many graces, particularly of <hi>Faith, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Humility,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denial.</hi> As the <hi>perfumed oyl</hi> that was poured upon <hi>Aarons</hi> head was made up of ſeveral ſweet ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; ſo is this grace a compound of many other graces; Where this is, we may aſſure our ſelves there are <hi>many graces</hi> exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis a frame and temper highly pleaſing to God. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. That <hi>a meek and a quiet ſpirit is in the ſight of God of great price.</hi> There is hardly a <hi>higher commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of any <hi>grace</hi> in the Scripture. That muſt needs be very <hi>excellent</hi> which is by God himſelf ſo highly eſteemed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis a <hi>frame of Spirit</hi> that gives God <hi>his due.</hi> They that are <hi>endued with it</hi> do acknowledge God as their Lord and owner. They acknowledge his plenary dominion over them. And 'tis fit and comely that we who received our life and being from God, ſhould own his Soveraignty and dominion over us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. 'Tis a frame of Spirit that will be greatly rewarded; For the <hi>more contented</hi> any man is the <hi>greater is his obedience</hi> to God, and the greater his obedience the greater will be his reward. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, even in this world a <hi>placid, quiet, ſedate frame of heart</hi> makes our <hi>life eaſie and delightful</hi> and ſo carries its reward along with it, whereas a <hi>turbulent diſcontented frame of Spirit</hi> diſorders and diſquiets a man beyond all expreſſion. And ſo much of the <hi>amiableneſs</hi> of this ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I come now to give ſome <hi>Directions</hi> for the attaining of it.</p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:66289:178"/>
               <p n="1">1. Mortify <hi>Pride</hi> which is the <hi>ſeminary</hi> of <hi>many ſins,</hi> eſpecially of this of <hi>repining.</hi> Compare your <hi>ſufferings</hi> and your ſins together, and ſee whether your ſins be not far more than your ſufferings. Conſider therefore not ſo much what you feel as what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider how many mercies and bleſſings you daily enjoy, and ſtir up your ſelf to be exceeding thankful for them. <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> and <hi>diſcontent</hi> cannot ſtand together. Therefore when ever you find your ſelf tempted to unquietneſs of mind, think of your mercies, and provoke and ſtir up your heart to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God for them; and that will drive away your diſcontent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider wherein the happineſs of man conſiſts, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſecure that happineſs to your ſelf. Do not eſtimate the happineſs of man by the opinion of worldly men who think thoſe men only happy who are rich and enjoy the pleaſures and delights of the world. But remember that mans <hi>true happineſs</hi> conſiſts in <hi>reconciliation with God</hi> through Chriſt, in <hi>conformity of our natures to him,</hi> in living holily and righteouſly, and <hi>being ſerviceable to God in our Generation according to our ſeveral capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> If it be thus with us, <hi>we are happy</hi> what ever our condition be in this world. People are much miſtaken in the nature of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> and have not the <hi>true meaſures of it.</hi> That is good to a man which makes him better, and that is evil to him which makes him worſe. Now ordinarily ten to one receive more hurt by <hi>proſperity</hi> than by <hi>adverſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Look <hi>downward</hi> on thoſe beneath you and not <hi>upward</hi> on thoſe above you. 'Tis a very <hi>ill natured thing</hi> for any man to think himſelf <hi>miſerable</hi> becauſe he ſees another to have <hi>higher en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments</hi> than himſelf. There is ſcarce a <hi>greater folly</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs</hi> incident to humane nature than a <hi>fond admiration</hi> of other mens <hi>enjoyments</hi> and a <hi>contempt of,</hi> and <hi>diſcontent at our own.</hi> Look not <hi>upward</hi> therefore on thoſe above you but look <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and you will find the world to be like a <hi>great Hoſpital</hi> full of <hi>poor, ſick, diſtracted, diſeaſed, pained, afflicted perſons,</hi> and how <hi>many thouſands</hi> will you find with whom you would be loath to <hi>change conditions.</hi> 'Twas a <hi>good ſpeech</hi> of one of the <hi>Ancients</hi> who ſaid, <hi>if all mens ſufferings were put into one common bank men would chooſe rather to go away with their own ſhare than take their dividend of the common calamities.</hi> Nay, conſider how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:66289:178"/> of Gods <hi>own Children</hi> have ſuffered for <hi>worſe things</hi> than any you have ſuffered. He that has his <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>all his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> intire, has in that an over-ballance to moſt outward adverſities. Conſider therefore how many mercies thou doſt ſtill enjoy. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur not at what thou haſt loſt but be thankful for what thou haſt left.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider <hi>no affliction comes out of the duſt.</hi> It is the Lord that brings us and our afflictions together. No <hi>warrant</hi> comes to arreſt our bodies with pain but it comes under the hand and ſeal of heaven. No <hi>Habeas-Corpus</hi> to remove any friend or relation of ours, but it comes under the hand and ſeal of the great judge. No affliction happens to us but it is reached out by the hand of God our Creator to whom we ow ſubjection as having received our being from him. Let us look therefore beyond inſtruments, for they are but the ſervitors to put the cup into our hands which our heavenly Father hath given us to drink.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let us conſider what part God hath appointed every one of us to act in this World, and let us labour to act that part well not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling our ſelves about the parts that others are appointed to act. The world is a great ſtage; 'Tis not ſo much material what part we are to act, provided we act it well. He that is appointed to <hi>act the part of a Servant</hi> and does it well is as much commended and rewarded as he that acted the <hi>part of a Maſter.</hi> In the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man the foot is of great uſe though not of ſo much as the head; It muſt not therefore complain becauſe it is not the head. Let every one duly conſider the place and ſtation God hath put him in, and the part and particular duty he requires of him, and let him ſet himſelf with all faithfulneſs to perform it, not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring at the part given to another.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A great help to contentment is to enjoy the preſent thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not to be over ſolicitous about the future. Wouldſt thou live contentedly? Be not over thoughtful for to morrow but caſt all thy cares on God, who hath promiſed that he will never leave nor forſake thoſe that are his, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Interpret all Gods providences ſo as intended to draw thee nearer to him and none of them to drive thee away from him. <hi>In very faithfulneſs haſt thou afflicted me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.75. Conſider, God has very gracious ends in afflicting his own people. (1.) <hi>Sanctified affliction</hi> is one of the moſt awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:66289:179"/> calls to repentance imaginable, and to this end God uſually deſigns it. As he ſayes by the Prophet, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 5.15. <hi>I will go and return to my place till they acknowledge their offence and ſeek my face. In their affliction they will ſeek me early. Joſephs Brethren are a great inſtance</hi> of this, who when they were put into priſon and brought into diſtreſs, then their conſciences began to tell them how they had uſed their Brother <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 24.21. <hi>Verily we are guilty concerning our Brother in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul when he beſought us and we would not hear, therefore is this diſtreſs come upon us.</hi> (2.) By ſanctified afflictions he calls for the exerciſe of their Faith, Patience, Humility, Self-denial, and will crown and reward the exerciſe of theſe graces which he himſelf hath planted in them. (3.) Hereby he crucifies their hearts to the world. As <hi>Nurſes</hi> lay <hi>worm-wood</hi> or ſome bitter thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their nipples when they intend to wean their Children, ſo God imbitters the world oftentimes to his own Children, to wean them from it. We read how <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſeeing a Soldier of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon any danger, and obſerving withal that he was very ſickly, took care to have him recovered to good health; which done, the man would not expoſe himſelf as before he had uſed to do, alledging that now his life was of more value to him and not to be hazarded as when it was only a burden. Thus we ſee how proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty makes men love the World whilſt afflictions wean them from it. (4.) Hereby he quickens their devotion and excites the ſpirit of prayer in them, whereas before (poſſibly) they were too cold and formal in their prayers, now they pray earneſtly. How did <hi>Daniel</hi> pray in the Lions den? How did <hi>Jonah</hi> pray in the Whales belly? How did the <hi>three Worthies</hi> pray in the fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace? People under afflictions pray at another rate than thoſe do who are at eaſe and in proſperity. (5.) Hereby he conforms them unto his Son who was a <hi>man of ſorrows</hi> and <hi>acquainted with griefs.</hi> And the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>If we ſuffer with him we ſhall alſo be glorified with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Take heed of all <hi>eager</hi> and <hi>inordinate deſires.</hi> There is ſcarce any thing in this world more dangerous to a man than ſuch vehement deſires. <hi>Omnis inordinatus appetitus ſibi ipſi poena eſt.</hi> Commonly God croſſes <hi>eager deſires,</hi> and there is not a more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to miſs any thing we have a mind unto, or to have it cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us, than over eagerly to deſire it. Strong affections breed
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:66289:179"/> ſtrong afflictions. Alas! we are very unmeet chooſers for our ſelves. We ſee not what that perſon or that place or that thing we ſo eagerly deſire, may prove. Many have been ready with <hi>Rachel</hi> to ſay, <hi>give me children or elſe I die,</hi> when thoſe children (they have ſo earneſtly deſired) have afterwards broken their hearts with grief and vexation at their ill-carriage. Whenever therefore we find any eager deſires or longings in our ſelves after any wordly thing, we ſhould be afraid of them and check them as foreboding ill to us. And further, we ſhould conſider how much our eager deſires after worldly things do ſhame and aggravate the weakneſs of our ſpiritual deſires. We can eagerly long for this or that worldly accommodation, can hardly ſleep for thinking of it, but for heaven or heavenly things how cold, how indifferent are we.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Seeing true <hi>Chriſtian contentment</hi> is a leſſon taught only in Chriſts School, let us all be willing to be his <hi>Scholars</hi> and put our ſelves into his School. <hi>Paul</hi> learnt this leſſon here. <hi>I know how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound, I am inſtructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to ſuffer need. I can do all</hi> (theſe) <hi>things through Chriſt ſtrengthning of me.</hi> Phil. 4.12, 13. <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have many <hi>precepts</hi> and <hi>directions</hi> about <hi>contentment;</hi> but alaſs they are all ſhort of teaching this leſſon <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually. Lipſius</hi> that had written a book <hi>de Stoica Philoſophia,</hi> and had gathered together many of <hi>their precepts of Patience,</hi> when he came to dye, a friend of his told him of <hi>that book,</hi> and adviſed him to remember what he had there written (yes ſayes he) but <hi>Domine da mihi patientiam Chriſtianam. Lord give me Chriſtian Patience;</hi> for that is it which I now need. But if this leſſon be only taught in Chriſts School, you will ask me <hi>how does Chriſt teach it?</hi> I anſwer, he teaches it three wayes, by his <hi>word,</hi> by his <hi>example,</hi> and by his <hi>Spirit.</hi> (1.) He teaches it by the <hi>Precepts</hi> of his <hi>word,</hi> whereby he enjoyns and commands it, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.19. <hi>In your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencei poſſeſs your ſouls,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.11. <hi>Follow after righteouſneſs, Faith, Love, Patience Meekneſs,</hi> Jam. 1.4. <hi>Let Patience have its perfect work that you may be intire, wanting nothing.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.6. <hi>Add to Faith Temperance to Temperance Patience to Patience Godlineſs. Becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my Patience</hi> (ſaith the Angel to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi>) that is, <hi>my word which I commanded thee, to be Patient. I will alſo keep thee from the hour of temptation.</hi> (2.) Chriſt teaches it by the Promiſes of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:66289:180"/> his word. He hath made many <hi>gracious promiſes</hi> in his word, which are a great means to ſupport his people and to frame their hearts to contentation in every condition. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. He hath made a promiſe of <hi>proviſion</hi> for them. <hi>Be content with ſuch things as you have, For he hath ſaid I will never leave thee nor forſake thee,</hi> Pſal. 34.10. <hi>The young Lions do lack and ſuffer hunger, but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing.</hi> In Pſal. 91.11. He hath made a promiſe <hi>of protection unto them. He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy wayes,</hi> Heb. 1.14. <hi>Are not they all miniſtring Spirits ſent forth to miniſter for them that ſhall be heirs of Salvation.</hi> In <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5.

He hath made a Promiſe to ſtrengthen his People under great preſſures. <hi>Fear thou not for I am with thee, Be not diſmai'd for I am thy God; I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> In Rom. 8.28. He hath made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>order all things for their good.</hi> We know (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>that all things work together for good to them that fear God.</hi> (3.) Chriſt teaches it by his own example. <hi>Learn of me</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, Mat. 11.29.) <hi>For I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye ſhall find reſt to your Souls.</hi> How ready was he to comply with his Fathers will? <hi>The Cup that my Father hath given me to drink, ſhall I not drink it,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>John</hi> 18.11. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.42. <hi>Father if thou be willing remove this Cup from me, yet not my will but thy will be done,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21. <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for us leaving us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps, who when he was reviled reviled not again, when he ſuffered he threatned not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> 4. He teacheth this leſſon by his Spirit. Now the ſpirit teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth contentment theſe wayes. (1.) By convincing the Soul of <hi>the reaſonablneſt of it.</hi> He ſhews that it is moſt fit and reaſonable, that God being our Creator and having abſolute ſoveraignty and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion

By ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our faith in the promiſes of God. (3.) By ſtrengthning our hearts to bear the burden of afflictions, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16. We are ſtrengthned (ſayes the Apoſtle) with <hi>might by his ſpirit in the inner man.</hi> And <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Strengthned with all might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his glorious power unto all patience and long ſuffering with joyfulneſs.</hi> And 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>God hath not given us the Spirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of a ſound mind.</hi> (4.) <hi>By ſhedding abroad a ſenſe of Gods love into our hearts,</hi> Rom. 8.16. <hi>The ſpirit beareth witneſs with our ſpirits that we are the Children of God, and if Children, then heirs, heirs of God and j ynt heirs with Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>ſo we rejoyce in hope of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God.</hi> Rom. 5.2.

               <p>For the <hi>Firſt. Covetouſneſs</hi> is an <hi>inordinate</hi> and <hi>exceſſive</hi> love of riches, and an <hi>immoderate deſire</hi> and hankering after them. The <hi>ſimple deſire</hi> ſo riches is not <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> but an <hi>inordinate</hi> and <hi>over-greedy</hi> deſire of them. And therefore this ſin is eſpecially in the heart. One may have little and yet be <hi>Covetous.</hi> One may be rich and yet free from Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> diſcovers it ſelf in theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In getting wealth <hi>unconſcionably</hi> without regard either to <hi>Piety, Equity, Juſtice, Charity</hi> or <hi>Humanity.</hi> When men have their hearts ſo bent and ſet upon the World that they uſe indirect means to get it, ſuch as are <hi>Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Over-reaching, Cheating, Lying, Stealing.</hi> And ſo in <hi>treaſuring up Wealth</hi> they treaſure up wrath to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In an <hi>unduede taining</hi> and <hi>with-holding</hi> from the Poor
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:66289:182"/> (through <hi>hard-heartedneſs</hi> and <hi>penuriouſneſs</hi>) what is fit to be given to them. When a man is ſo <hi>ſtrait-hearted</hi> and <hi>ſtrait-handed</hi> in works of <hi>Charity,</hi> ſo <hi>cruel,</hi> ſo <hi>hard,</hi> and <hi>miſerable</hi> that he gives not <hi>at all</hi> to the poor, or <hi>very little,</hi> and only what is <hi>extorted</hi> from him with great difficulty and importunity. When men are continually <hi>hoarding up</hi> for themſelves, but have no bowels or pity for the poor or their indigent relations; and though they have enough and abound, yet are inordinately carking and caring for more ſtill, being perplexed with an <hi>Infidel fear</hi> leſt they ſhould want when they are old. Like <hi>Symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> who being asked why he was <hi>Covetous in his old age,</hi> Anſwered, <hi>I had rather leave riches to my enemies when I die, than ſtand in need of my friends while I live.</hi>

And ſo likewiſe</hi> Eccleſ. 4.8. <hi>There is one alone and there is not a ſecond. Yea he hath neither Child nor Brother, yet there is no end of all his labour nor is his eye ſatisfied with riches. Such men</hi> (as one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it) are like the <hi>Aſſe</hi> that carries <hi>Gold</hi> for others, but it ſelf feeds on <hi>thiſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo much of the <hi>Particulars</hi> wherein Covetouſneſs expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I come now to conſider the cauſes of Covetouſneſs. And they are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Falſe notions and apprehenſions</hi> about riches, and too <hi>high an eſteem</hi> of the things of the World. They think the <hi>happineſs</hi> of man conſiſts in having plenty and abundance.
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:66289:182"/> And upon this conceit <hi>wealth</hi> ſo ſteals away their hearts that they make it their God. They will tell you what <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſayes, that <hi>money anſwereth all things,</hi> Eccleſ. 10.19. that is, it will buy any thing that can be bought here; and therefore they that have <hi>money in their purſe</hi> have the world at their will. But I ſhall tell them alſo what the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Godlineſs is profitable for all things</hi> (which <hi>Money</hi> I am ſure is not) <hi>having the promiſes of this life and that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> makes men rich without riches, rich in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> rich in <hi>this,</hi> that <hi>God is reconciled to them in his Son,</hi> and they have his favour ſhining upon them <hi>here,</hi> and have a good title to Heaven <hi>hereafter.</hi> I know the World is ready to ſay of a man that hath gotten wealth, O ſuch a man is made, whereas (except God give him grace with his riches) he may thereby be marred. He may be <hi>made</hi> indeed in one ſenſe, that is, made more proud more imperious, more irreligious, more idle, more luxurious than he was before, but that is far from being <hi>any felicity to himſelf,</hi> or any <hi>benefit to others.</hi> The World has very little judgment in the true nature of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil.</hi> That is truly <hi>good</hi> for a man which makes him <hi>better</hi> towards God, and that is <hi>evil</hi> for him which makes him <hi>worſe.</hi> Indeed <hi>riches</hi> when <hi>honeſtly got</hi> are Gods bleſſings, and ſo ought to be eſteemed by us, and we ought to be very thankful to God for them. But by reaſon of the corruption of mans heart they are often to many men <hi>ſnares,</hi> yea, very <hi>dangerous ſnares.</hi> Riches <hi>without grace</hi> uſually hurt the <hi>Poſſeſſor. I have ſeen riches reſerved to the hurt of the owners thereof</hi> ſayes <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.13. And not only to their hurt, but to the hurt of many others round about them. Many men had never been ſo great ſinners nor had they diſhonoured God nor hurt and corrupted others at ſo high a rate, if they had not been ſo great and rich in this World. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our therefore <hi>Mark</hi> 10.23. ſayes, <hi>How hardly ſhall they that have riches enter into the Kingdom of God?</hi> that is, that <hi>have riches,</hi> but not grace to make a right uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them. There are indeed great <hi>temptations</hi>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:66289:183"/> in <hi>Poverty.</hi> But I think we may truly ſay, that if the <hi>temptations of Poverty</hi> have ſlain <hi>their thouſands</hi> the <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of riches</hi> have ſlain their <hi>ten thouſands.</hi> I know <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſayes <hi>no man can know love or hatred by theſe outward things,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.1. that is, we cannot know Gods <hi>love</hi> or <hi>hatred</hi> to us by the meer <hi>outward diſpenſations</hi> either of <hi>riches</hi> or <hi>poverty, proſperity</hi> or <hi>adverſity;</hi> but we may by the <hi>inward impreſſions</hi> that are made upon our hearts by thoſe diſpenſations. He to whom God giveth riches and withal an <hi>humble, thankful, charitable, beneficent</hi> frame of heart, to him they are <hi>given in mercy.</hi> But he who hath riches and by them is made more <hi>proud, inſolent, vain, wanton, intemperate, oppreſſive, injurious</hi> than he was before, I think hath no great cauſe to imagine his riches are <hi>given him in mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another cauſe of Covetouſneſs is mans diffidence and diſtruſt of Gods fatherly care and providence over them. <hi>Ignorance</hi> of God and diſtruſt of God uſually go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>They that know thy name will truſt in thee</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 9.10.) <hi>For thou haſt not forſaken them that ſeek thee.</hi> They that <hi>know thy name,</hi> that is, thy <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>attributes,</hi> they that know how <hi>infinitely wiſe, gracious, merciful, faithful</hi> thou art, will put their truſt in thee, but they that are ignorant of thee will not truſt in thee but in their own wiſdom and providence. Men uſually take it very ill, when they ſee they are not truſted. How much more may the great God of Heaven, <hi>take it ill</hi> from us when he ſees we dare not truſt him. It is an engagement upon the Almighty (to ſpeak with reverence) to <hi>truſt in him, to depend on him and to caſt our cares on him.</hi> But it muſt needs be a great provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him to diſtruſt him. Therefore our Saviour in <hi>Mark</hi> 6. <hi>from</hi> 25. to the end charges his Diſciples three ſeveral times <hi>to take no thought for their life what they ſhould eat or drink, or for their body what they ſhould put on, for about theſe things the Gentiles (that knew not God nor acknowledged Providence)</hi> inordinately carked and cared. But thoſe that profeſſed themſelves his <hi>Diſciples</hi>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:66289:183"/> ſhould <hi>ſeek in the firſt place the Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs,</hi> and for <hi>other things</hi> they ſhould not be <hi>over anxious,</hi> but believe that God in the uſe of lawfull and fair means would beſtow them upon them, as far forth as he ſaw to be good for them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another cauſe of Covetouſneſs is this, <hi>men</hi> live by <hi>ſenſe</hi> more than by <hi>Faith.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.2. that <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> that is, it doth convincingly <hi>ſhew</hi> and <hi>demonſtrate</hi> the <hi>reality</hi> of <hi>things not ſeen.</hi> And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. He ſhews the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent temper of the true Chriſtian from the man of the World. The <hi>true Chriſtian</hi> chiefly minds the things <hi>unſeen.</hi> The <hi>men of the World</hi> mind chiefly the things <hi>ſeen.</hi> The one minds things <hi>temporal</hi> the other things <hi>eternal.</hi> Some perſons have three eyes (as one obſerves) the <hi>eye of ſenſe,</hi> the <hi>eye of reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>eye of faith.</hi> Worldly men have the <hi>two former</hi> the <hi>eye of ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> but they want the eye of <hi>Faith.</hi> They ſee what it is to have a <hi>good eſtate,</hi> a <hi>good houſe,</hi> a <hi>good ſtock,</hi> to have <hi>pleaſant accommodations</hi> for this life. But for Heaven and the other life they never ſpake with any body that came from thence, and they do not much give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to conſider what kind of life that is that is there lived. They ſavor and reliſh earthly things, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things ſeem to them to have no taſt in them. But the true Chriſtian exerciſes himſelf in the meditation of things inviſible, and lives in the <hi>believing views</hi> of the <hi>excellency</hi> and reality of thoſe things, and by faith aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains them to himſelf. The <hi>Martyrs</hi> had their hearts ſet on things <hi>unſeen.</hi> The <hi>inviſible comforts</hi> and <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes</hi> of the other life bore up their hearts againſt the terrors of <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>preſent torments.</hi> And ſo much of the <hi>cauſes</hi> of Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I come now to ſhew what are the <hi>marks</hi> and <hi>characters</hi> of ſuch as are Covetous and Earthly-minded, and who may be ſtiled <hi>men of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:66289:184"/>
               <p n="1">1. Men whoſe <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>skill</hi> lyes <hi>only</hi> or <hi>chiefly</hi> about the things of the world. They are <hi>ſhrowd underſtanding men</hi> in worldly matters, but in <hi>the things of God</hi> and ſuch as concern their Souls and their everlaſting welfare <hi>meer Children.</hi> In the things that concern their <hi>trades</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions</hi> they are notable men, but talk with them about the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> about <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Regeneration,</hi> about the true nature of <hi>Repentance</hi> or <hi>Faith,</hi> and they know little.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their hearts are chiefly ſet on theſe things. The <hi>things of the World</hi> they love and affect, as being ſutable to their ſpirits. The Apoſtle commands us 1 John 2.15. <hi>Not to love the World nor the things of the World;</hi> for <hi>all the things of the World</hi> may be reduced to <hi>theſe three heads, the luſt of the fleſh</hi> or ſenſual pleaſures, <hi>the luſt of the eye</hi> or riches and ſuch things as are ſeen with the eyes, and the <hi>pride of life,</hi> that is, preferments and honours. But though the Apoſtle commands we ſhould not ſet our hearts or affections on theſe things, yet this is the Worlds <hi>Trinity,</hi> and more <hi>adored</hi> by them than <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Their diſcourſe is chiefly about theſe things. 1 John 4.5. <hi>They are of the World therefore ſpeak they of the World.</hi> Their breath is earthy which they ſay is a ſign of death. Talk with them about <hi>worldly things,</hi> none more free to diſcourſe than they. But ſpeak to them of matters that concern their Souls, they have nothing to ſay. Such diſcourſe is uſually unpleaſing to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their pains and endeavours<note n="*" place="margin">Rem Rem, quocunque modo Rem —Ocives querenda pecunia pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum eſt. Virtus poſt nummos.</note> are only or chiefly for the things of the World. They take little pains about their own Souls or the ſouls of thoſe under their care, but are mighty induſtrious about the things of the World; They <hi>riſe early</hi> and <hi>ſit up late</hi> to acquire them, but a ſhort attendance upon <hi>religious duties</hi> and <hi>exerciſes</hi> what a <hi>wearineſs is it</hi> to them and they are ready to <hi>ſnuff at it</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. They take a great
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:66289:184"/> deal of care and pains how they may live here it may be ten or twenty or thirty years, but they take no thought how they ſhould live a thouſand years hence when they have left their bodies in the earth. Oh were the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of <hi>theſe men</hi> for the ſaving of their immortal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls but any thing anſwerable to the pains they take to <hi>get the World,</hi> how happy might they be? God is not always pleaſed to bleſs and ſucceed the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of men who are very diligent in their calling, and painful and laborious to get wealth. God ſees it beſt to keep them low. But what man ever was diligent and ſerious in ſeeking the things of eternal life, and <hi>working out his Salvation</hi> that did not find God aſſiſting of him and proſpering his endeavours?</p>
               <p n="5">5. They are very careful to ſecure to themſelves thoſe <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things,</hi> but uſe no anſwerable care to ſecure to themſelves <hi>things eternal.</hi> They are very careful about the <hi>Titles</hi> of their <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Purchaſes,</hi> and hardly ever think themſelves ſecure enough. Let a <hi>Miniſter</hi> come to one of theſe men on his <hi>Death-bed</hi> and ask him concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>evidences</hi> of his eſtate, he will tell him they are all ſafe in ſuch a trunk or cheſt. But let him ask him what evidences he has that his Soul is in a ſafe condition. Alas! He has nothing to ſay; He has not minded thoſe things. His Soul is left upon miſerable uncertainties. He has taken no care to ſecure to himſelf erernal<note n="*" place="margin">Nulla ſatis magna ſecu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He has taken care to leave a <hi>clear eſtate</hi> to his children, but no care to <hi>clear his Soul of guilt</hi> or to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf from the <hi>wrath that is to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. They are commonly very ſolicitous about their own <hi>private intereſt,</hi> but little or nothing <hi>concerned</hi> about the <hi>intereſt of Chriſt</hi> or <hi>his Church.</hi> They are wholly and only for themſelves. We read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.13. that <hi>old Eli's heart trembled for the Ark of God,</hi> which was the <hi>ſymbole</hi> of his gracious preſence among them. But how little are worldly and earthly-minded men concerned how it fares with the Church of God, provided their
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:66289:185"/> own private worldly concernments be ſafe and ſecure?</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Theſe outward things</hi> they make their truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. They ſet their <hi>prime affections</hi> of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>truſt</hi> upon them in that meaſure which is only due to God. <hi>The rich mans wealth is his ſtrong City.</hi> Prov. 10.16. <hi>They make Gold their hope and fine Gold their confidence,</hi> Job 31.24. <hi>Their wealth</hi> is the <hi>Idol</hi> upon which they dote. Their <hi>confidence and truſt</hi> is taken off from God and placed upon their riches. As the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.7. <hi>Lo theſe are the men that make not God their ſtrength but truſt in the abundance of their riches.</hi> And <hi>this their way is their folly</hi> and a courſe very <hi>injurious</hi> to God who ſhould be the <hi>only object of our truſt,</hi> and can only help us in a day of trouble. The Scripture doth frequently diſſwade men from ſuch carnal confidence. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Charge them that be rich in this World that they be not high-minded nor truſt in uncertain riches, but in the living God.</hi> Pſal. 62.10. <hi>If riches increaſe ſet not your hearts upon them. And our Saviour himſelf gives us this precept,</hi> Matth. 6.19. <hi>Lay not up for your ſelves treaſures upon earth where moth and ruſt doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and ſteal; but lay up for your ſelves treaſures in heaven, where neither moth nor ruſt doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor ſteal. For where your treaſure is there will your hearts be alſo.</hi> And ſo much of the <hi>marks</hi> and <hi>characters</hi> of ſuch as are <hi>earthly-minded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. I come now to ſhew the <hi>great evil</hi> of <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis a ſin the <hi>Scripture</hi> teſtifies very much againſt. (1.) 'Tis called <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Epheſ. 5.5. Col. 3.5. becauſe the Covetous man loves<note n="*" place="margin">Amor tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Deus tuus.</note> his money more than God, and more truſts in it. (2.) 'Tis called the root of all evil, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10.

He whoſe affections are inordinately ſet on money will not ſtick at the breach of any of Gods commandments.

               <p n="2">2. 'Tis a very <hi>cloſe ſin.</hi> 'Tis a ſin hardly diſcerned, and ſo more hardly cured. 'Tis a ſecret ſubtil ſin that hides it ſelf under the cloak of frugality and good husbandry. A man may be free from unlawful getting, from deceit and injuſtice, and yet be earthly-minded for all that. If God ſhould ſuffer a Profeſſor to fall into drunkenneſs or uncleanneſs, his conſcience would be ſure to flye in his face, and ſeverely talk with him. But people that are Covetous and Earthly-minded hardly diſcern themſelves to be ſo, or think it no crime to be ſo, though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. reckons the Covetous among thoſe that ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</p>

There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny come to hear the word, and ſit before the Lord <hi>as his people, whoſe hearts go after their Covetouſneſs,</hi> Ezek. 33.31. and ſo the word profits them not.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It unfits a man to be a good <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> or a good <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</hi> A <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſhould be a man <hi>fearing God,</hi> and <hi>hating Covetouſneſs,</hi> Exod. 18.21. <hi>A Goſpel Miniſter</hi> ſhould not be <hi>greedy of filthy lucre,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.2. If either of them be under the power of Covetouſneſs they are never like to diſcharge their duties faithfully.</p>
               <p n="7">7. 'Tis a very <hi>diſquieting ſin.</hi> It diſquiets the hearts of men and deprives them of inward peace. <hi>They that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet after money pierce themſelves through with many ſorrows,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. It creates alſo a great deal of trouble and diſquiet to particular Families. <hi>He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own houſe</hi> ſayes <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 15.27. <hi>A covetous Maſter of a Family</hi> will make his Children and Servants very ſlaves and drudges and will hardly allow them things neceſſary and Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It exceedingly hinders a <hi>due preparation for death.</hi> They that have their hearts <hi>over-charged with Covetouſneſs and the cares of this life</hi> ſeldom take their <hi>latter end into due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. How hardly</hi> (ſayes our Saviour) <hi>ſhall they that have riches enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Math.
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:66289:186"/> 10.23. that is, that <hi>have their hearts ſet on their riches, and truſt in them.</hi> Corpulent birds ſeldom flye high. Neither do they whoſe great care is <hi>to load themſelves with thick Clay,</hi> Heb. 2.5, 6. mind Heaven or the things of the other life.</p>
               <p>And ſo much of the evil of Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I come now to give ſome directions, and to preſcribe ſome remedies againſt it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Labour to underſtand wherein the <hi>true happineſs</hi> of man conſiſts. Riches and wealth are not the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marks of the favour and love of God. Men may have them, and yet be of the number of them who <hi>have all their portion in this life,</hi> Pſal. 17.14. God indeed does ſometimes give <hi>riches</hi> to his <hi>own children,</hi> that they may appear to be his <hi>blſſiengs.</hi> And to many of his own children he denies them, that they may appear not to be his chief bleſſings. The <hi>true happineſs</hi> of man conſiſts in <hi>reconciliation with God,</hi> in <hi>conformity of his nature to him,</hi> in <hi>having his Spirit dwelling in him and in being ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to him in his generation.</hi> He that hath theſe is <hi>truly rich,</hi> though he be <hi>poor in this World.</hi> And he that <hi>wants theſe</hi> though he <hi>flow in riches and wealth,</hi> yet I am not affraid to tell him he is for the preſent but a <hi>miſerable man</hi> and in an unſafe condition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the people of God ought to have a <hi>great confidence</hi> in Gods Fatherly care over them. We are much preſſed in Scripture to <hi>caſt our care on God,</hi> Pſal. 55.22. <hi>Caſt thy burden on the Lord and he ſhall ſuſtain thee,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.7. <hi>Caſt all your care on him for he careth for you,</hi> Matth. 6.31. <hi>Take no thought for your life wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> you ſhall eat or what you ſhall drink, or for your body what you ſhall put on, but ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> What makes children and ſervants leſs ſolicitous and anxious, leſs careful and covetous in their Parents and Maſters houſe than when they are for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:66289:187"/> Why, they depend on their Parents and Maſters to provide for them, and that ſets them at eaſe as to that particular. And ſhould not we then depend on the care and providence of our heavenly Father? Why ſhould we not truſt God for our bodies as well as for our ſouls, conſidering the many gracious promiſes he has made to take care of us? The Apoſtle uſes this as a great argument againſt Covetouſneſs and <hi>that we ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſuch things as we have,</hi> becauſe God hath ſaid <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee,</hi> Heb. 13.5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We ſhould labour to moderate our affections to the things of this World. Holy <hi>Agurs</hi> prayer was, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Give me neither Poverty nor Riches, but feed me with food convenient for me.</hi> Our Saviour tells <hi>Martha, Luke</hi> 10.42. that <hi>one thing is neceſſary.</hi> 'Tis not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary we ſhould be rich or learned, or healthful, or have a great name in this World; but 'tis abſolutely neceſſary to our happineſs that we ſhould <hi>break off our ſins by true repentance,</hi> that we ſhould be converted, that we ſhould ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly cloſe with Chriſt by Faith, that we ſhould be new creatures, that we ſhould live to the honour of God and good of the World. If theſe things be found in us, God hath given us the beſt portion, and therefore we may well be contented though he give us not ſo large a portion of the things of this life. Yea, upon this account in a good cauſe <hi>we ought to take joyfully the ſpoiling of our goods,</hi> or the loſs of our eſtates, remembring that God hath given us a <hi>better portion</hi> that cannot be taken from us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We ſhould conſider our Souls are Spirits and were made for higher things than meerly to grovel on the earth. Our Souls are our beſt part, and our greateſt care ſhould be to ſecure them. If it go well with the ſoul it will go well with the body alſo. But if the ſoul be loſt and muſt ſuffer everlaſting puniſhment, 'twere better we had been made <hi>Toads</hi> or <hi>Serpents</hi> than <hi>Men</hi> and rational creatures. Certainly it argues the great depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:66289:187"/> of mans Soul that it ſhould take ſo much care for the body how it may be cloathed and fed and how it may injoy all the delights which are ſuitable to it, and that it ſhould take ſo little care of it ſelf to ſecure unto it ſelf eternal happineſs. In order therefore to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our ſouls we ſhould labour to poſſeſs our minds with right and ſound principles, ſuch as theſe, <hi>That the beſt part of man ought to have moſt care beſtowed upon it, That things of everlaſting conſequence ought to be ſought before things of meer temporal concernment, That things abſolutely neceſſary ought to be ſought in the firſt place,</hi> That <hi>he is a wiſe man that takes due care to ſave his ſoul, but he is a fool that to gain the World loſes his Soul.</hi> Such <hi>Principles</hi> as theſe laid deep in our minds may be a great means to preſerve us from an eager and greedy purſuit of the things of the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We ſhould conſider <hi>our time here is but ſhort,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.29. therefore we had not need act the part of children and only follow bubbles. We have but a ſhort winters-day of life to live. If a man come to a great City and have a great deal of buſineſs to do and but a ſhort day to do it in, he had not need trifle, but mind the buſineſs ſeriouſly for which he came thither. Let us therefore mind our great buſineſs for which we came into the World, let us look to the main whatever elſe be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We ſhould take heed of earthly-mindedneſs and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the things of the World too eagerly, leſt that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to us which ſometimes happens to thoſe that dig in the mines of the earth, while they are eagerly digging and delving there, the earth falls on them on a ſudden and miſerably buries them. Let thoſe that follow the World ſo hard (with the wretched neglect of their ſouls) and are loading themſelves continually with thick clay take heed they be not at laſt cruſhed under it and periſh by it.</p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:66289:188"/>
               <p n="7">7. We ſhould ſet before our eyes the examples of the moſt eminent Saints and ſervants of God in all ages. They counted themſelves but <hi>Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>ſtrangers</hi> here, Heb. 13.37. and yet they were ſuch <hi>of whom the world was not worthy. Scultetus</hi> obſerves that none of the Saints men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scripture were ſpotted with this ſin of Covetouſneſs. The Apoſtle tells us that <hi>Abraham ſojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Land of Promiſe as in a ſtrange Country becauſe he looked for a City which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi> And the truth is, they that have God for their Father, Chriſt for their Redeemer, the Holy Ghoſt for their guide and comforter, the holy Angels for their Protectors, the Promiſes of God for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſupport, and Heaven for their inheritance hereafter, ſhould have their hearts withdrawn from worldly things and ſhould more mind and think of their Countrey that is above.<note n="*" place="margin">Dum mala pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt bona promiſſa ungunt.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Thoſe to whom God hath given riches in this World ſhould conſider that theſe are their particular duties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſhould labour to get the <hi>ſpiritual riches of grace</hi> which they may carry with them into the other World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ſhould not over-value their riches nor eſteem them too highly, nor ſet their hearts upon them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They ſhould not put their truſt or confidence in them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They ſhould not glory in them, nor boaſt of them. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They ſhould not be tempted by their riches to ſcorn or deſpiſe the poor, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They ſhould not by reaſon of their wealth and power oppreſs the poor.</p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:66289:188"/>
               <p n="7">7. They ſhould <hi>honour the Lord with their ſubſtance,</hi> Prov. 3.9. (1.) By promoting Piety and the ſervice of God. (2.) By works of Charity<note n="*" place="margin">Quas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deris ſolas ſemper ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebis opes.

Now riches are made friends when they are ſo uſed as they may be evidences, and give teſtimony of our <hi>Piety, Charity, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercifulneſs.</hi> A <hi>poor mans hand</hi> (whom we have relieved) is a bill will be accepted in Heaven, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.17. <hi>He that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord, and he will pay him again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. They ſhould often and ſeriouſly meditate on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they muſt give how they have uſed their wealth. They ſhould conſider they are not <hi>abſolute Lords</hi> of their eſtates but <hi>Gods ſtewards,</hi> and to him they muſt give an account.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They ſhould be willing to let go whatever God ſhall call them to part with, and that without regret or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, as if a piece of their heart were rent away with it.</p>
               <p>And ſo much of the <hi>remedies</hi> and <hi>directions</hi> againſt Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now ſhut up this diſcourſe with this <hi>one Caution,</hi> that ſeeing <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> does eſpecially conſiſt in the <hi>inward deſires</hi> of the heart which are beſt known to a mans ſelf (and which no man knows <hi>ſave the ſpirit of a man that is in him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.11.) We ſhould therefore be very wary and tender of charging Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs upon others. We may more ſafely and ſecurely judge our ſelves in this matter than we can others. For we can better know the nature and qualification of our own deſires than we can poſſibly of another mans. Let us therefore take heed of <hi>evil ſurmizes</hi> and <hi>ungrounded ſuſpicions</hi> of others. Some perſons are apt to ſurmize a man to be covetous upon ſuch grounds as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He will not be bound for a friend or relation though in
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:66289:189"/> never ſo great a ſtrait. I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I think no man ought to be bound for another any further than he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf able and willing to pay in caſe the perſon for whom he is bound cannot. For ſo the perſon to whom the bond is made looks upon him; and if he be not ſo, he deceives him in being bound. This being premiſed, I ſhall now tell you what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes of ſurety-ſhip, Prov. 17.18. <hi>A man void of underſtanding ſtriketh hands and becometh ſurety in the preſence of his friend.</hi> Chap. 22.28. <hi>Be not thou one of them that ſtrike hands or of them that are ſurety for debts.</hi> Chap. 11.15. <hi>He that is ſurety for a ſtranger ſhall ſmart for it, and he that hateth ſurety-ſhip is ſure.</hi> Chap. 6. v. 1. <hi>My Son if thou be ſurety for thy friend, if thou haſt ſtricken thy hand with a ſtranger, thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth; Do this now my Son, go humble thy ſelf and make ſure thy friend, give not ſleep to thine eyes nor ſlumber to thine eye-lids; deliver thy ſelf as a Roe from the hand of the Hunter, and as a Bird from the hand of the Fowler, &amp;c.</hi> you may ſee by this what <hi>Solomons</hi> opinion was of ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſhip. The truth is, many an eaſie and good natured man hath been utterly undone by being drawn into bonds for his friend or relation. And therefore I think it is not a ſign ſo much of a covetous mind as of a prudent mind to be ſhy of ſurety-ſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He lives very neerly and ſparingly and much under his eſtate. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou maiſt ſurmiſe his eſtate to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than it is. Thou doſt not know his loſſes nor his manifold charges. Or it may be, having ſeen the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and dangerous temptations that others have been put upon through want, he ſpares that he may not be expoſed to the like temptations. Or it may be he ſpares and in many things denies himſelf that he may have to give to the poor. His frugality is the purſe-bearer to his Charity. Or poſſibly he will tell thee (who vainly and fooliſhly ſpendeſt thy money) that thou doſt not know the value of a penny. One ſingle penny will buy a yard ſquare of good Land worth
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:66289:189"/> twenty pound an acre, as may appear by the demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the margin<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <p>In every Acre there are a hundred and ſixty ſquare Poles or Rods. In every Pole (co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3, It does not appear that he is Charitable and liberal to the Poor. <hi>Anſw.</hi> He may be prudent in well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his Charity and Conſcientious in obſerving that rule of Chriſt, Mat. 6.3. <hi>When thou giveſt alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.</hi> He may poſſibly give much more to the poor than thou knoweſt of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He layeth up much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou canſt not tell what part of his eſtate he layeth up yearly, nor to what ends. The Apoſtle preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth it as a duty belonging to Parents to <hi>lay up for their Children.</hi> 2 Cor. 12.14. and 1 Tim. 5.8. He ſayes that <hi>if any man provide not for his own houſe he is worſe than an Infidel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude all, ſeeing Covetouſneſs is ſo ſecret and cloſe a ſin and conſiſts chiefly in the inward deſires of the heart, let us all carefully obſerve the frame of our own hearts, let us be ſevere and rigid in examining our ſelves, but let us be charitable and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did towards others.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of Anger.</head>
               <p>IN treating of this <hi>Subject</hi> I ſhall proceed in this Method.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. I ſhall ſpeak of the nature of <hi>Anger.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Of the <hi>kinds</hi> of it.</item>
                  <item>3. Give ſome <hi>directions</hi> for the right <hi>regulating of it,</hi> that we may not offend therein.</item>
                  <item>4. Anſwer the <hi>vain excuſes</hi> that <hi>angry perſons</hi> are apt to make for themſelves.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the <hi>firſt. Anger</hi> is an affection by which the blood and ſpirits are heated upon the apprehenſion of ſome injury or wrong offered to us or thoſe for whom we are concerned. Or <hi>Anger is the riſing up of the heart</hi> in a <hi>paſſionate diſpleaſure</hi> againſt <hi>an evil</hi> which we apprehend will croſs or hinder us of ſome deſired good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Anger</hi> is either good or evil according to the circumſtances with which it is attended. <hi>It is good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. When the cauſe for which we are angry is good and warrantable and ſuch as we can give a good account of to God, Mark 3.5. <hi>Jeſus looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardneſs of their hearts.</hi> When we are angry, (and our anger is accompanied with grief) becauſe God is diſhonoured, or becauſe we ſee people offend againſt Piety, Juſtice, Humanity, or becauſe we ſee them neglect their duties and hurt their own ſouls, or the Souls of others, or do that which is
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:66289:190"/> wicked and ſinful or prejudicial and hurtful to us or others. This is a juſt cauſe of Anger.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the object is right. The object of our anger muſt not be the Perſon offending, but his offence, his vice, his ſin, his immorality, his folly, his fault. Theſe we may be angry at, yea hate, but not the offenders perſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the End is right. When the end of our <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> is, that the fault we are angry with may be amended, and the Perſon offending for the future may be warned not to offend in the like kind again.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When there is no exceſs in the meaſure of our anger or the time when our <hi>anger</hi> is only a <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diſpleaſure;</hi> when <hi>reaſon</hi> commands it, <hi>thus far it ſhall go and no farther,</hi> when it neither is <hi>too hot</hi> nor <hi>too long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Anger</hi> is <hi>good</hi> when it is thus <hi>qualified</hi> and <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiated,</hi> namely, when it <hi>ariſes upon a good</hi> and <hi>juſtifiable ground;</hi> when it is directed upon the <hi>right ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> the ſin and fault of the offender; when it aims at the <hi>right end, the reformation of the Perſon offending;</hi> and when it is neither too hot nor too long, but when it fails in <hi>theſe circumſtances,</hi> it is <hi>evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I am come now in the third place to give <hi>ſome directions</hi> for <hi>the right regulating of our anger</hi> that we may not offend therein.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Make account every day that you may meet with <hi>many occaſions</hi> that will be apt to provoke you to anger,<note n="*" place="margin">Praeſume animo mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta tibi eſſe patienda, Sen. de ira.</note> if you be not very watchful over your ſelf. Every <hi>morning</hi> think with your ſelf that you may that day meet with ſome <hi>croſs and finiſter accidents,</hi> ſome <hi>unexpected injuries, troubles</hi> or <hi>inconveniencies,</hi> which (without great care and taking heed to your ſelf) may diſorder and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you.</p>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:66289:191"/>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider that you your ſelf are ſubject to <hi>manifold</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and <hi>failings,</hi> and you muſt not expect to meet with or converſe with any that are totally free from failings and infirmities. Who is there alſo who hath not a <hi>blind ſide</hi> on which he doth not ſee? <hi>In many things we offend</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Tangat memoriam communis fragilitas.</note> 
                  <hi>all</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. Keep alive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſenſe of your own weakneſs and what need you have of <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> both from God and Man, and that will more diſpoſe you to patience towards others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take heed of being <hi>ſoon angry;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Multos abſolvemus ſi prius coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimus judicare, quam iraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci. <hi>Sen.</hi> de <hi>Ira.</hi>

Give leave to your <hi>judgement</hi> to conſider before you be angry. <hi>The diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a man deferreth his anger, Prov.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was adviſed not to be angry at any time till he had firſt ſaid over the <hi>Greek Alphabet.</hi> 'Tis a ſhame that we that are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould not preſcribe as <hi>good Rules</hi> to our ſelves to keep us from falling too ſuddenly into Paſſion as the <hi>Heathens</hi> did.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Be not angry upon every <hi>trivial occaſion.</hi> He that is angry <hi>without cauſe</hi> (ſayes our Saviour) <hi>is in danger of the judgment,</hi> Matth. 5.22. We ſhould not be angry for any thing that is not material in it ſelf, or in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents. We ſhould not be angry for meer <hi>involuntary</hi> and <hi>caſual offences,</hi> ſuch as without great care could not have been prevented. To be angry for every toy debaſes the value of our anger. A man muſt not (as one ſayes) <hi>fire the Beacon of his Soul</hi> for the landing of every <hi>Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Take heed you be not angry too often. For when a man is frequently and often angry, his anger grows into
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:66289:191"/> contempt and works no good effect. Anger muſt be uſed as a medicine, only now and then, and that only upon juſt occaſion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Take heed your anger be not too hot nor too vehement and exceſſive. It muſt be ſerious indeed, and have ſome life and warmth in it, that it may be effectual for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and amendment of the offending Perſon, and may be a warning to him to avoid the like faults for the future. But yet we muſt take heed of all exceſſes, and tranſports of this Paſſion.<note n="*" place="margin">Ira ſic dicta quia hominem facit <hi>ex ſe ire,</hi> &amp; non eſſe apudſe.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. In your anger make no raſh vows or reſolutions.

               <p n="8">8. In your anger be ſure to reveal no ſecrets formerly committed to your truſt. For that makes a man a <hi>Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi> for ſociety ever after. No man will care to have any thing to do with him, who hath ſo little <hi>wit</hi> or <hi>honeſty</hi> in his anger as to reveal what was before committed to him under the <hi>ſeal of ſecreſie.</hi>

               <p n="9">9. Take heed of bitter <hi>provoking ſpeeches</hi> when you are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry.

               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Do not peremptorily break off any buſineſs in a fit of anger. Conſider that nothing can be done in paſſion but may be done better without it. For Paſſion is no good coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſellor. It uſually blinds the mind and hinders due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſo expoſes a man to do things very unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Ponder beforehand with your ſelf what are the uſual cauſes of anger, that ſo you may take heed of them. And they are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Pride.</hi> This is a great cauſe of anger. <hi>Proud and high minded men</hi> are uſually apt to be very angry and to conceive a <hi>great indignation, if their judgements and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings be not vailed unto,</hi> and their <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> complied with, Prov. 13.10. <hi>Only by Pride cometh contention,</hi> Prov. 21.24. <hi>Proud and haughty Scorner is his name who deals in fierce wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. An opinion of being contemned either in word or deed. A ſenſe of contempt, or that the injury received had much of contempt in it doth uſually more ſtir up anger than the injury it ſelf, and ſo the manner aggravates the matter.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:66289:192"/> Therefore when men ſtudy to find out <hi>circumſtances of contempt</hi> in an injury received, they kindle their anger to a <hi>great height.</hi> If you would therefore prevent anger, ſever the injuries you receive (as much as you can) from contempt or malice, and impute them to raſhneſs, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inconſiderateneſs, to any thing rather than contempt, which the nature of man can ſo hardly bear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Covetouſneſs.</hi> They that are eager upon the world, and have their hearts ſet upon earthly things, are apt to be very <hi>angry</hi> and <hi>cholerick</hi> when things fall out croſs to their minds. They are uſually very angry abroad when they meet with loſſes and diſappointments, but almoſt <hi>mad at home;</hi> diſpleaſed with Wife, Children, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; ſcarce any thing can pleaſe a covetous man when his profit and commodity is croſſed. Every little treſpaſs or loſs toucheth him to the quick and maketh him <hi>impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Overmuch niceneſs</hi> and <hi>delicateneſs.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Nulla res magis iracundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am alit quam luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</note> 
                  <hi>Tender and delicate</hi> perſons are ſubject to be angry. Any little thing is apt to put ſuch perſons into a fit of choler. Thoſe that are rich and great in this world many times take liberty from their <hi>greatneſs</hi> to give <hi>ſcope to their Paſſions,</hi> and ſo not only diſturb themſelves but diſquiet thoſe about them, and make their lives uneaſie to them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>over much tenderneſs</hi> of Spirit. We ſee that anger uſually <hi>reigns</hi> moſt in <hi>weak perſons,</hi> as in <hi>old folks</hi> and <hi>ſick folks,</hi> in <hi>women</hi> and <hi>children.</hi> A great imbecility certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is, for a man to have too tender a ſenſe,<note n="*" place="margin">Dure tractandus eſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ut ictum non ſentiat niſi grav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Take heed therefore that your mind be not too delicate and tender and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh and apt to be moved at every toy. We ſhould harden our minds that they may not have too quick a ſenſe of injuries. A man ſhould not think his credit or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in danger by every idle word ſpoken againſt him.
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:66289:193"/> The remedy of this is (as a learned man obſerves) to get <hi>telam honoris craſſiorem;</hi> a thicker web of honour that will not ſo eaſily ravel out.</p>

               <p n="7">7. <hi>Credulity</hi> and an eaſie belief of reports and liſtning to <hi>Tale-bearers</hi> is another cauſe of anger.

               <p n="13">13. Repreſent to thy ſelf the <hi>miſchievous nature</hi> and <hi>hurtfulneſs</hi> of intemperate Anger.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis a great enemy both to the <hi>mind</hi> and to the <hi>body.</hi> It fills the mind with <hi>vexation</hi> and a <hi>bitter diſcontent.</hi> It unfits it for any <hi>holy duty,</hi> for <hi>prayer, meditation, hearing the word, receiving the Sacrament,</hi> or any <hi>communion</hi> with God. And ſhould not that be very odious to us which unfits us for the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God, or receiving any benefit by his ordinances?

               <p n="2">2. 'Tis a great <hi>diſquieter of private families and ſocieties</hi> of men.

How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands hath <hi>intemperate anger</hi> wronged and injured, hurt and wounded? Yea, how many thouſands hath it <hi>deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>murdered?</hi> What villany hath not <hi>ſinful anger at one time or other</hi> been guilty of?</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis a <hi>great diſquieter of the Church.</hi> The anger that is vented about matters of Learning or Religion is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the moſt irreligious, moſt outragious and worſt of all. The contentions about points of Learning or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are uſually very hot and fierce and yet one would think Learning ſhould civilize the minds of men. 'Twas ſaid ſo of it of old <hi>Emollit mores nec ſinit eſſe feros.</hi> But alas! who are they that write againſt one another with greater ſharpneſs and keenneſs, who are there that mingle more gall with their ink than learned men do? And for Religion, certainly where it is in reality it is the beſt principled and beſt natured thing in the world. It breaths in <hi>meekneſs, patience, forbearance, and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and yet ſo powerful is the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Corruption of mans heart,</hi> that there are no controverſies managed with ſo much <hi>bitterneſs, ſharpneſs,</hi> and <hi>exaſperation</hi> as the controverſies about Religion are. Let any man look into the books that are witten by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> by the <hi>Lutherans</hi> againſt the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> by the <hi>Arminians</hi> againſt the <hi>Anti-arminians;</hi> or look into the ſeveral Sects
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:66289:194"/> and Parties that not long ſince prevailed in theſe Nations; or let him caſt his eye on the late diſputes between the <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> and <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and he ſhall quickly ſee what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>intemperate heat</hi> and <hi>anger,</hi> what abundance of <hi>diſingenuity</hi> and <hi>incivility,</hi> what abundance of <hi>ill will</hi> and <hi>uncharitableneſs</hi> doth appear in theſe writings. No man cares to go to a <hi>Phyſitian</hi> who will rail upon him and revile him and tell him that he is not worthy to live, and 'twere better the world were rid of him. And yet thus do ſome men treat <hi>their adverſaries</hi> who pretend to write books for their information, and to reduce them into the right way. Certainly 'tis the duty of all <hi>real Chriſtians</hi> who agree in the <hi>main fundamentals</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to forbear <hi>one another</hi> in matters of leſs moment, and which belong not to the <hi>vitals</hi> of Chriſtianity. For we are all apt to <hi>err</hi> and <hi>miſtake in ſome things,</hi> and we cannot ſee with any bodies <hi>eyes</hi> but our <hi>own.</hi> And 'tis a horrible <hi>uncharitableneſs</hi> to ſay that any man is <hi>wilfully blind,</hi> who opens his eyes as wide as he can. We muſt all ſee for our ſelves and judge for our ſelves and our own practice, and make account to anſwer to God for our ſelves. And therefore ſurely it would become us to be more charitable one towards another than uſually we are. But 'tis a vain thing to complain in this matter. I ſhall rather turn my complaint into a fervent prayer unto God, that he would pleaſe by the <hi>all-powerfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi> of his <hi>grace</hi> to change the hearts of men, and to give them a better frame of Spirit.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Let not anger reſt in your boſom</hi> leſt it <hi>putrify</hi> and turn into <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>hatred.

Meekneſs towards Man conſiſts in having a heart ready to <hi>paſs by offences,</hi> to <hi>forgive wrongs</hi> and <hi>injuries</hi> and to do <hi>good</hi> againſt <hi>evil.</hi> And there is not a <hi>greater magnetiſm</hi> or <hi>attractive</hi> in <hi>nature</hi> than ſuch a frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>The <hi>great amiableneſs</hi> of <hi>meekneſs</hi> will appear to us if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe particulars</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Meek perſons</hi> are like unto our Lord and Saviour, who expreſſed his great meekneſs in ſubmitting to his Fathers will without any repining, and in bearing patiently great injuries from men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learn of me for I am meek and lowly of heart.</hi> Our Saviour ſeems to ſay to us as <hi>Gideon</hi> to his followers, Judges 7.17. <hi>Look on me and do as ye ſee me do.</hi> And accordingly the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1. <hi>obteſts</hi> and <hi>beſeeches the Corinthians</hi> by the <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>gentleneſs</hi> of Chriſt (which he uſes as a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motive to them) that they would not interpret his humble and mild carriage among them otherwiſe than they ought.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Gracious meekneſs doth plainly ſhew the ſoul to have been under the <hi>forming</hi> and <hi>workmanſhip</hi> of the Spirit
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:66289:195"/> of God. We may by the work know the workman.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis a temper <hi>highly prized by God himſelf,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.4. <hi>A meek and a quiet Spirit is in the ſight of God of great price, Moſes's meekneſs</hi> exalted him ſo highly that God ſpake unto him <hi>face to face,</hi> as a man ſpeaketh to his friend, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. 'Tis a temper that much adorns our Chriſtian Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>'Tis a walking worthy of our high calling,</hi> Eph. 4.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>I Paul beſeech you that ye walk worthy of the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith you are called, with all lowlineſs and meekneſs, and long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in love,</hi> and Verſe 31, 32. <hi>Let all bitterneſs and wrath, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and clamor, and evil ſpeaking be put away from you, with all malice, and be ye kind one to another, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> The Apoſtle alſo expreſſes himſelf to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p n="5">5. 'Tis a temper to which many <hi>gracious promiſes</hi> are made, Pſal. 25.9. <hi>The meek will he guide in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the meek will he teach his way,</hi> and Mat. 5.5. <hi>The meek ſhall inherit the earth,</hi> that is, they ſhall enjoy that which God gives them here with much more <hi>Peace, Quietneſs</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> than others do. Meek perſons are not given to Lawing and quarrelling as other men are, if they be oppreſſed at any time God does uſually intereſt himſelf in their quarrel, Prov. 16.7. <hi>When a mans wayes pleaſe the Lord he maketh his very enemies to be at peace with him.</hi> And if God does ſometimes for graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ends ſuffer the meek to be oppreſſed, (namely, for the exerciſe of their faith and patience) he will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence them abundantly in the other life.</p>
               <p n="6">6. 'Tis a temper of great benefit and advantage to the life of man. It takes the edge off from ſufferings that they cannot wound and hurt us; Whereas he that frets and rages makes that troubleſome to him which elſe
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:66289:196"/> would not be ſo. As in caſe of <hi>reproachful words,</hi> which in themſelves neither <hi>hurt our bodies nor leſſen our eſtates,</hi> but the great danger of them is if they drive us into anger. For then our anger may run us into abundance of other ſins. Whereas he that meekly paſſes them by is never the worſe for them, nay the better, (as God orders it) For he ſhall be rewarded for his <hi>Patience.</hi> And ſo much of the <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>benefits</hi> of <hi>meekneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. Another Direction is this. Be humbled ſeriouſly before the Lord for all <hi>former irregular</hi> and <hi>exorbitant Paſſions</hi> thou haſt been guilty of, and ſeek pardon of them in the blood of Chriſt, and pray earneſtly unto the Lord to keep thee from falling into the like again, and to give thee the <hi>wiſdom which comes from above</hi> which is <hi>firſt pure then peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, and full of good fruits.</hi> And when thou art ſurprized on a ſudden with any <hi>unexpected accident</hi> or <hi>violent temptation</hi> that is apt to diſorder thee, then ſend up a <hi>fervent ejaculation</hi> to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as a ſpeedy meſſenger for help and ſuccour in that time of danger.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Laſtly, Set a high price and value upon quietneſs, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a calm frame of Soul, 1 Theſ. 4.11. <hi>Study to be quiet and to do thy own buſineſs.</hi> And ſo much of the directions for the <hi>right regulating</hi> of our anger.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I come to conſider the <hi>excuſes</hi>

                  </note> that thoſe that are prone to be angry do uſe to make for themſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are ready to ſay that <hi>their afflictions</hi> are ſo <hi>great</hi> and ſo <hi>heavie</hi> that they cannot <hi>bear them with any pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And therefore they may ſay as <hi>Jonah</hi> did, that <hi>they do well to be angry,</hi> and <hi>that it is better for them to dye than to live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Be ſilent all fleſh before God.</hi> What art thou <hi>O Man, O Worm,</hi> that <hi>thou replieſt againſt God? Aaron</hi> had two Sons deſtroyed at one ſtroke by fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And they both dyed (for ought appears to the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:66289:196"/> contrary) <hi>in their ſin,</hi> and that is a <hi>ſharper affliction</hi> than ever thou metteſt with. And yet the text ſayes, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Aaron held his peace,</hi> he uttered not one word of <hi>murmuring</hi> or diſcontent againſt the Almighty. <hi>To murmur againſt God</hi> is to <hi>throw a ſtone upward,</hi> that will be ſure to <hi>fall on his head</hi> that threw it. Take heed therefore of <hi>inward repining,</hi> or <hi>outward murmuring</hi> againſt the Almighty, how heavy ſoever his hand be upon thee. <hi>Shall a living man complain?</hi> (ſayes the moanful Prophet, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39.) Man ſuffereth for his ſin. God is alwayes juſt, though his wayes to us are ſometimes amazing and paſt our finding out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are ready to ſay that the provocation upon which they were angry, was ſo great that <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> could not bear it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A Cholerick temper I confeſs may ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſe them to anger, but cannot neceſſitate them to it. And if they did pray earneſtly to God for the aſſiſtance of his grace and ſet a watch over themſelves, they might bring themſelves into better order. But ſome people ſeem to expect that God ſhould do all for them and neither earneſtly beg grace from him to help them, nor endeavour ſeriouſly in the power he vouchſafes to them to mortify the corruptions of their hearts. If a
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:66289:197"/> 
                  <hi>great reward</hi> were propounded to a <hi>Cholerick</hi> man on condition he abſtained from falling into any <hi>unſeemly paſſion</hi> for <hi>one day</hi> whatever provocation were offered him, ſurely he would do it. And if a man may by <hi>great watchfulneſs</hi> abſtain <hi>one day</hi> for a temporal reward, why ſhould he not do it the <hi>next day,</hi> and the <hi>next after</hi> that out of obedience unto God? There are ſeveral <hi>gracious Chriſtians</hi> that are not <hi>eaſily, frequently,</hi> or furiouſly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry nor miſ-behave themſelves in their anger by word or deed. Do you endeavour to do ſo likewiſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are ready to ſay that <hi>ſuch a man</hi> was <hi>exceſſively hot and angry</hi> with them, and why ſhould not they be ſo with him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No man muſt go about to cure an evil with an evil or to correct a vice by a vice, fire is not quenched by fire nor anger with anger. 'Tis more Chriſtian-like to <hi>give place to wrath,</hi> and <hi>and overcome evil with good.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. X. Of Idleneſs.</head>
               <p>THE Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> Chap. 16.49. tell us, that <hi>this was the iniquity of Sodom, Pride, fulneſs of bread, and abundance of Idleneſs, neither did ſhe ſtrengthen the hands of the Poor.</hi> I wiſh <hi>abundance of Idleneſs</hi> were not at this day a ſin found in <hi>England</hi> as well as in <hi>Sodom,</hi> and that among the wealthieſt, and thoſe of the beſt rank and quality in the Nation, whoſe education one would think ſhould have taught them better things, <hi>Seneca</hi> complained of old that men ſpent their time either in <hi>nihil agendo</hi> or <hi>aliud agendo,</hi> or <hi>male agendo,</hi> either in <hi>pure idleneſs</hi> and <hi>doing nothing,</hi> or doing things of ſmall moment and conſequence, or in doing things evil and wicked. I wiſh this were not too true of many among us in theſe dayes, who either idle and ſquander away their precious time or unuſefully and impertinently imploy it, or elſe imploy it in ſin and wickedneſs, little conſidering that diligence in doing evil is but a making haſte to hell. A diſcourſe therefore that tends to ſhew people how neceſſary it is to their happineſs, that <hi>they ſhould well imploy their time,</hi> and not fooliſhly and careleſly ſquander it away, I hope cannot be unſeaſonable. The Apoſtle, Epheſ. 4.15, 16. makes <hi>circumſpect walking and redeeming time</hi> to be <hi>the great Character</hi> to diſtinguiſh thoſe that are wiſe from thoſe that are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. <hi>See that ye walk circumſpectly</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the time.</hi> This is the Subject therefore that I ſhall now ſpeak to, and in the handling of it I ſhall ſhew,

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>Time paſt,</hi> there is no <hi>recalling of that;</hi> the loſs of it ought to be bewailed by us and that with great bitterneſs.<note n="*" place="margin">Damna fleo rerum, ſed plus fleo damna dierum.</note>

               <p n="2">2. For <hi>Time to come,</hi> that we are uncertain of. Only <hi>two times</hi> we are aſſured will come; <hi>the time of Death and the time of Judgement.</hi> And he is no <hi>wiſe man</hi> that does not provide and prepare himſelf againſt <hi>both theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Time preſent. This</hi> only is <hi>our time</hi> and this we ſhould labour well to <hi>imploy, improve</hi> and <hi>husband</hi> to the beſt advantage. And ſo much of the <hi>firſt particular,</hi> what is meant by <hi>redeeming Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To <hi>what purpoſes</hi> are we to redeem time?</p>
               <p>There are many <hi>excellent purpoſes</hi> for which we ſhould do it. Particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To <hi>conſider our wayes,</hi> and find out the ſins of our lives, that we may <hi>humble our Souls</hi> before the Lord for them, and may undoe them again by true Repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To <hi>ſue out our Pardon</hi> and make our <hi>Peace with God</hi> by <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking</hi> our ſelves to Chriſt Jeſus, and giving up our ſelves to him to be <hi>Pardoned</hi> through the infinite merit of his <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> obedience, and to be ſanctified by his <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To conſider what <hi>unruly affections</hi> are in us, that we may ſet our ſelves (through the aids of grace) to <hi>ſubdue</hi> and <hi>mortify</hi> them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To conſider how we may frame <hi>our outward converſation ſo,</hi> as may tend to the honour of God and credit of our <hi>Profeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:66289:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="5">5. To conſider <hi>what is the part</hi> that God hath appointed us to act in this world and what are the <hi>peculiar duties</hi> incumbent on us, in reference to <hi>our particular calling and ſtation,</hi> that we may perform them, <hi>wiſely, faithfully,</hi> and <hi>diligently;</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. To conſider that <hi>this life</hi> is <hi>our ſeed-time,</hi> and that we ſhall <hi>reap hereafter</hi> according to what we <hi>ſow here.</hi> And therefore we had need look to it that we ſow <hi>good ſeed</hi> and do <hi>what good</hi> we can while we have opportunity. <hi>He that ſowes to his fleſh ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption, and he that ſowes to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life everlaſting,</hi> Gal. 6.7.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To conſider that we are not only to take care to <hi>clear our own Souls of guilt,</hi> but to humble our ſelves for the <hi>crying ſins</hi> of our Nation by which our <hi>Heavenly Father is highly diſhonoured,</hi> that ſo we may do <hi>our part</hi> to <hi>ſtand in the gap,</hi> and divert the wrath of God. And ſo much of the purpoſes for which we are to redeem Time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I come now in the third place to conſider from what we muſt redeem time.</p>
               <p>There are many things from which we muſt redeem it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>ordinary buſineſs</hi> and <hi>affairs</hi> of this life. For though we are to be <hi>diligent</hi> in our particular callings, yet we muſt not ſuffer <hi>our worldly buſineſs to ingroſs all our time.</hi> We muſt labour ſo to contrive the buſineſs of our callings that they may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon that time which we are to imploy for the <hi>good of our Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. From the <hi>lawful refreſhments of our lives,</hi> ſuch as <hi>eating, drinking, ſleeping, recreations,</hi> &amp;c. In which there is very often <hi>too much</hi> of our time ſpent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From <hi>Converſation</hi> and <hi>company,</hi> eſpecially <hi>ſuch company</hi> among whom we cannot expect either <hi>to do good</hi> or <hi>to receive good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We muſt be eſpecially careful how we employ <hi>our ſolitary hours</hi> and when we are alone; that we do not ſpend <hi>that time</hi> n <hi>melancholy and impertinent muſings and rovings</hi> and <hi>wandrings of thoughts,</hi> but imploy it in <hi>meditation on things profitable and uſeful.</hi> And if we had the care and skill to keep our minds
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:66289:199"/> 
                  <hi>to good works</hi> when we are <hi>alone,</hi> It would be of <hi>incredible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> to us both for the <hi>improving of our reaſon,</hi> and much more to improve us in real piety and Chriſtianity. And ſo much of the <hi>third Particular, From</hi> what we muſt redeem time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What are the <hi>reaſons</hi> that ſhould preſs this duty upon us?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our <hi>time is but ſhort,</hi> we have but a little of it. We have not <hi>ſeven or eight hundred years of life,</hi> as the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> had before the <hi>flood.</hi> Mans life is now ordinarily very ſhort. <hi>Few</hi> live to <hi>threeſcore years and ten,</hi> and <hi>very few to four-ſcore.</hi> And take out of the <hi>longeſt life</hi> that any live here (1.) The <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>inconſiderateneſs of Child-hood and youth.</hi> (2.) The <hi>time ſpent in eating, drinking, and ſleeping,</hi> though <hi>with moderation.</hi> (3.) The time of <hi>ſickneſs and indiſpoſition</hi> of health. (4.) The time ſpent in <hi>journeys</hi> and <hi>travel.</hi> (5.) The time ſpent in <hi>recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and viſiting of friends.</hi> (6.) The time of <hi>weakneſs, valitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narineſs, unuſefulneſs</hi> in old age, I ſay take out all theſe; and the reſidue that remaineth for our buſineſs of greateſt moment and conſideration we ſhall find will be but a ſmall <hi>pittance</hi> or <hi>portion.</hi> And therefore having <hi>ſo little time,</hi> we had not need waſte it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our time flyes away very <hi>ſwifly.</hi> Job 9.25, 26. compares it to three very ſwift things, to a <hi>Poſt,</hi> to a <hi>Ship on the Sea</hi> and to an <hi>Eagle flying to her prey.</hi> Let any one conſider how ſoon a <hi>year</hi> is gone, and then tell me whether <hi>time</hi> does not fly away apace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A great deal of our time we have already <hi>miſpent;</hi> Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on our <hi>infancy, Childhood,</hi> and <hi>youth,</hi> Alas! How <hi>many years</hi> have paſſed over our heads ere we came to have <hi>any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> for <hi>what end</hi> we came into the world, or <hi>what work</hi> we had here to do? Nay how many in <hi>their youth have weaved thoſe curſed wehs of ſin</hi> which muſt be afterwards <hi>unweaved</hi> and <hi>undone again</hi> with <hi>great ſorrow and ſhame?</hi> Nay <hi>how much of the time</hi> which we have ſpent in Gods <hi>own worſhip</hi> may be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to our <hi>loſt time?</hi> God commands us <hi>to uſe the World as if we uſed it not.</hi> But we are apt to <hi>pray as if we prayed not</hi> and to <hi>hear as if we heard not, and to worſhip God in ſuch a cold and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal manner</hi> as if we minded not what we were about.</p>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:66289:199"/>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider what a damned ſoul in hell would give for a little time to recover himſelf out of that woful miſery, if it were in his power to purchaſe it. O how cutting muſt it needs be to him to think how he might have procured everlaſting joy and bliſs to himſelf, but he fooliſhly neglected his time and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the doing of it, which is not now to be recovered. If God by an extraordinary diſpenſation ſhould grant to a damned Soul one moneth or week to come out of hell upon tryal, ſurely ſuch a perſon would better improve his time than before he had done. When people come to die, at how dear a rate would they be willing to purchaſe ſome of thoſe hours, which they foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly mis-ſpent and ſquandered away before.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider, time is a Talent which we muſt account for. As we muſt not vainly waſte and mis-ſpend our eſtates, ſo neither may we our time. Time is an Univerſal Talent that every one that lives to the years of diſcretion is intruſted with. Every man hath not a Talent of Learning or Wealth, but every man who liveth to years of underſtanding is intruſted with a Talent of Time, which he may improve to his great advantage: if he be not wanting to himſelf. How highly guilty then are thoſe careleſs waſters of time, and thoſe voluptuous livers, whoſe time lies upon their hands, and if they have not almoſt every day a new diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement to paſs away their time (as they wickedly phraſe it) they know not what to do with it. O wretches! do you ſtudy to paſs away that which flyes away ſo faſt? You had need clip its wings or hang leaden Plummets upon it, to ſtop its courſe and keep it from flying away ſo faſt, if you could poſſibly do it. You ſay you are for a ſhort life and a merry. Surely you think to live in the World like <hi>Leviathan in the Sea,</hi> meerly to ſport and take your paſtime therein. <hi>Hark you in your ear,</hi> you that are ſuch prodigal ſpenders and waſters of your precious time, This is the time that God hath allotted you to work out your ſalvation in with fear and trembling. If a condemned Malefactor had but two or three dayes allowed him to ſue out his pardon, do you think that he would ſpend that time in ſports and paſtimes in feaſtings and merriments, in idle viſits and complements with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſenſe or regard in what condition he was, and how his life was certainly and unavoidably at an end, if he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his pardon? I ſuppoſe you would not think him in his wits,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:66289:200"/> if he ſhould ſo do. 'Twas a woful ſpeech of that dying perſon who cryed out on his death-bed, <hi>call Time again, O call Time again.</hi> But that could not be done.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another reaſon why we ſhould redeem time is that given by the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Becauſe the dayes are evil.</hi> 'Twas not in our power to order in what part of time ſince the Creation we ſhould be born. God (in whoſe hands our times are and who determines our times and the bounds of our habitation, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.26.) hath appointed us to live in theſe evil times, and therefore we ſhould now more eſpecially endeavour to redeem our time and improve it for all thoſe excellent purpoſes before mentioned. There are three things that ſpeak times to be evil.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When <hi>iniquity</hi> abounds and <hi>little reſtraint</hi> is laid upon it, but there are great examples to incourage it.</item>
                  <item>2. When <hi>great troubles</hi> and <hi>ſufferings</hi> befall the people of God, and ſuch as deſire <hi>to walk in all good conſcience</hi> towards <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. When the <hi>times</hi> are full of <hi>ſnares</hi> and <hi>temptations</hi> whereby multitudes are intrapped. And if <hi>theſe things</hi> be found among us <hi>at this day;</hi> We had need from <hi>this conſideration</hi> as well as the <hi>former,</hi> endeavour to make the beſt improvement of our Time.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="5">5. I come now to give ſome <hi>directions</hi> as to the manner how time ſhould be redeemed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider there is <hi>no part of your time</hi> you ſhould be more careful well to improve than the <hi>ſeaſons of grace</hi> which God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords you. The Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>a time of viſitation,</hi> Luke 19.44. <hi>Of a day of Salvation,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2. Of a <hi>time wherein the Lord may be found,</hi> Iſa. 55.6. Of a <hi>time wherein the Spirit of God ſtriveth with the children of men,</hi> Gen. 6.3. And <hi>this time</hi> of <hi>all times</hi> ought to be <hi>well improved.</hi> But you will ſay poſſibly, how ſhall we know <hi>this day of Gods viſitation</hi> and <hi>of the ſtriving of his Spirit with us?</hi> I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> you may know it by theſe things (1.) When he caſts you by his providence under a <hi>powerful</hi> and <hi>awakening Miniſtry,</hi> whereby you are ſhewed the great evil and danger of your ſins, and the abſolute neceſſity of <hi>your converſion,</hi> if you intend to be ſaved.</p>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:66289:200"/>
               <p n="2">2. When his <hi>holy Spirit co-operates with that Miniſtry</hi> and draws and perſwades your hearts to <hi>break off your ſins by repentance</hi> and to turn to God and to lay hold on the offers of his grace in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When he ſends ſome <hi>awakening afflictions,</hi> either publick or private upon you, whereby he makes your hearts ſoft and tender and ready to embrace good counſel.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When he affords you the <hi>company</hi> and <hi>example</hi> of <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>faithful Chiſtians</hi> who are ready to <hi>help</hi> and <hi>forward,</hi> and <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> you in the way to Heaven. When God affords you <hi>theſe helps,</hi> highly value and prize them as ſpecial favours from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and account that <hi>this is the day of your viſitation,</hi> this is <hi>your ſeaſon of grace,</hi> and therefore be very careful to make a right im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it. <hi>All wiſe men</hi> are careful to lay hold on, and to improve all fit <hi>ſeaſons</hi> and <hi>opportunities</hi> for the effecting the buſineſs they deſign. For that may be done <hi>in its fit ſeaſon</hi> which cannot be done out of it. How eaſie is it to <hi>ſayl with the wind</hi> or to <hi>form iron while it is hot.</hi> But theſe things cannot be done at another time. The caſe is thus alſo in reference to the Soul. <hi>Seaſons of grace</hi> muſt by no means be neglected. For as there is a <hi>time of viſitation</hi> which God affords to the children of men, ſo there is a time wherein (men having outſtood their viſitation) <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God will no longer ſtrive with them.</hi> And though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly determine <hi>this time;</hi> yet there are <hi>ſome things</hi> that are ſhrewd ſigns of it, which it will behove us all well to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and to examine our ſelves whether ſuch ſigns be found in us or no. Thoſe ſigns are ſuch as theſe</p>
               <p n="1">1. When people have long lived under the <hi>powerful means of grace</hi> and are nothing bettered by them, but are as <hi>ignorant or worldly,</hi> as <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>ſenſual</hi> as before, Obſerve what our Saviour ſayes, Luke 13.7. <hi>Theſe three years have I ſought fruit on this fig-tree and have found none, cut it down, why cumbreth it the ground?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When people have had <hi>many convictions and ſecret workings of the Spirit of God in their hearts,</hi> and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and <hi>quenched them.</hi> Obſerve what God ſayes by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 24.13. of that people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have purged thee (that is, have uſed means to
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:66289:201"/> purge thee by ſending my prophets unto thee,) <hi>and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt not be purged from thy filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs any more till I have cauſed my fury to reſt upon thee.</hi> And dreadful are thoſe words of the Lord alſo, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.17. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols let him alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. When God ſends <hi>affliction</hi> after <hi>affliction</hi> upon them, and they are nothing amended by them, Eſay. 1.5. <hi>Why ſhould you be ſtricken any more, you will revolt more and more?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. When they come to have a <hi>vile eſteem</hi> of the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of Chriſt, and of his <hi>Ordinances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. When they go on <hi>confidently and preſumptuouſly</hi> in their ſins, notwithſtanding all the warnings and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings they have had to the contrary, Deut. 29.19, 20. <hi>When they ſhall bleſs themſelves ſaying, I ſhall have peace though I walk after the imaginations of my heart, adding drunkenneſs to thirſt, the Lord will not ſpare that man, but his anger and jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where <hi>theſe black marks</hi> are found, we have great cauſe to fear that <hi>ſuch men</hi> have <hi>out ſtood the day of their viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But whatever others do, let us look to it that we carefully improve <hi>our day of grace.</hi> And that is the firſt <hi>Direction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Diſpatch in the firſt place, and with the <hi>greateſt care and diligence</hi> thy great work which muſt be done or thou art undone for ever. Secure thy <hi>intereſt in Chriſt</hi> and the pardon of all thy ſins <hi>in him,</hi> thy <hi>ſtate in grace and thy title to Heaven.</hi> And when <hi>that great work</hi> is once <hi>well done,</hi> thou may'ſt go <hi>quietly and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> about thy worldly affairs and buſineſſes. The generality of men are the <hi>verieſt children</hi> and <hi>fools</hi> as <hi>to their main concernment</hi> imaginable. They mind the world ſeriouſly but neglect the one thing abſolutely neceſſary. If a King ſhould ſend his <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> and give him among the reſt, <hi>one principal inſtruction,</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him above all things to <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>obſerve that; which if he did</hi> he ſhould be highly <hi>rewarded</hi> at his return, but if he neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it he ſhould <hi>forfeit his head.</hi> I queſtion whether <hi>any inſtance</hi> can be give ſince the world began of any <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> ſo <hi>ſtupid</hi> and <hi>careleſs</hi> as to neglect a matter that ſo much concerned him. But alas! how oft is this done by the children of men in a <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:66289:201"/> of greater moment? Thou</hi> that wouldeſt, it may be ſeverely have cenſured and condemned <hi>this Ambaſſad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r,</hi> if he had ſo groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected his duty, <hi>de te fabula narratur</hi> thou <hi>art the man;</hi> This thing is more than <hi>verified</hi> of <hi>thee</hi> who mindeſt the things of this life but neglecteſt the great buſineſs for which thou cameſt into the world, and which above all other things thou ſhouldeſt have minded. There is no neceſſity that thou ſhouldeſt be rich and leave ſuch an inheritance <hi>to thy Son,</hi> or ſo <hi>many hundreds in thy inventory,</hi> but it is of <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> thou ſhouldeſt be <hi>converted and repent of thy ſins,</hi> and get thy ſoul <hi>cleared of all thy guilt</hi> by faith in Chriſt, and ſhouldſt <hi>honour God</hi> in this world, and ſhould'ſt be in ſuch a <hi>poſture</hi> and <hi>frame of mind and heart</hi> that thou may'ſt be <hi>fitted to dye. Theſe things</hi> are neceſſary to thee, <hi>the other</hi> are not. Labour therefore to do <hi>thy great work</hi> in the <hi>firſt place,</hi> and do not <hi>defer it</hi> and put it off; God calls thee now to repent; do not <hi>put God off</hi> and ſay <hi>thou wilt do it hereafter.</hi> Ask thy ſelf this <hi>one ſerious queſtion,</hi> whether <hi>thou ever doſt intend to repent or no?</hi> If not, thou declareſt <hi>thou inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt to damn thy Soul.</hi> If thou doſt intend to repent, why wilt thou not now do it? The <hi>longer thou delayeſt,</hi> the more <hi>unfit</hi> thou wilt be. Beſides, conſider this, thou in thy <hi>diſtreſſes</hi> and <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> cryeſt to God to relieve thee and to help thee preſently. When thou art in pain or under a grievous ſickneſs thou wouldſt think it hard if God ſhould ſay, <hi>I will eaſe thee of thy pain ſeven years hence,</hi> why ſhouldſt thou then <hi>put God off</hi> with delayes? And 'tis a <hi>ſad obſervation</hi> that ſome make concerning thoſe that <hi>wilfully delay</hi> to turn to God, namely that few of them are converted at laſt. Therefore <hi>upon all theſe accounts</hi> defer not thy <hi>main work</hi> thy <hi>converſion to God, and ſecuring thy peace with him,</hi> whatever elſe thou neglecteſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Labour to keep certain <hi>ſet times</hi> for thy <hi>private devotions,</hi> and be conſtant to them. Eſpecially be careful to <hi>obſerve the Lords-day</hi> well. From our <hi>conſcienciouſneſs</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi> in the duties of Gods worſhip and ſervice <hi>on that day,</hi> we may make a probable conjecture of the ſucceſs of our worldly affairs and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes the week after. This a <hi>learned man</hi>

               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:66289:202"/>
               <p n="4">4. Keep <hi>conſcience tender</hi> and that will reprehend thee for <hi>waſting thy time</hi> or <hi>ill imploying it.</hi> Thou wilt then be careful not to ſpend it in any thing that thy conſcience will reproach thee for, and which muſt be repented of afterwards. Remember, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>conſcience</hi> muſt be <hi>pleaſed</hi> whoever be <hi>diſpleaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Promiſe not to thy ſelf <hi>long life,</hi> but live as one that is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain of another day.</hi> The groundleſs expectation of <hi>long life</hi> makes people many times leſs careful rightly to improve the <hi>preſent time.</hi> Men will ſpend <hi>prodigally</hi> out of a <hi>full purſe,</hi> who otherwiſe would be <hi>ſparing</hi> if they knew they had but little. 'Tis obſerved of ſome that have promiſed themſelves <hi>long life,</hi> that they have been cut off very <hi>ſuddenly.</hi> Thou reckoneſt poſſibly upon years; whereas, it may be, thou haſt not moneths to live. However, ſay this to thy ſelf every <hi>morning. I am now brought to the beginning of a new day;</hi> O my ſoul! let me <hi>improve this day</hi> well, ſo as I may give a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table account of it unto God. The <hi>Sun</hi> may return again after it hath ſet. But <hi>this day</hi> when it is once gone I ſhall never ſee again.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Take heed of <hi>thoſe things</hi> that <hi>rob</hi> people of their time, and watch carefully againſt them. And they are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>ſluggiſh and ſloathful habit of mind. Spontanea laſſitudo aſpontaneous laſſitude</hi> or <hi>wearineſs</hi> is a ſign the body is out of order. And a voluntary <hi>ſloathfulneſs and ſluggiſhneſs</hi> is a ſign of a <hi>diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Soul ſloath</hi> is an <hi>averſeneſs</hi> from <hi>that labour</hi> which is our duty through a carnal love of eaſe. He is moſt <hi>ſinfully ſloathful</hi> who is moſt <hi>voluntarily ſloathfull.</hi> 'Tis certainly a very <hi>dangerous life</hi> for any man to <hi>live out of a calling</hi> or to be idle and ſlothful in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. But the <hi>worſt kind of ſloth</hi> is a <hi>backwardneſs</hi> and <hi>liſtleſneſs</hi> to our <hi>greateſt duties.</hi> The Apoſtle cautions us not to <hi>be ſloathful in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> but <hi>fervent in Spirit ſerving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12.11. And if we would but take pleaſure in the work God calls us unto, we ſhould not then be weary of it or ſlothful in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Overmuch ſleeping and drouzing and lying a bed.</hi> Suppoſe there be two <hi>young ſcholars,</hi> whereof one ſleeps but <hi>ſix hours</hi> uſually in a night and the other <hi>nine.</hi> The one of theſe out-lives the other 21 hours in a week, how much will he gain of him a year?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Too long dreſſing and finefying the body.</hi> Indeed <hi>neatneſs</hi> and <hi>cleanlineſs</hi> are very commendable; but <hi>overmuch curioſity</hi> in <hi>dreſſing</hi> and <hi>adorning</hi> the body, as it is a <hi>great vanity</hi> ſo it is a great and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary expenſe of time.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:66289:202"/>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Long viſits</hi>

                     <hi>Amici</hi> ſures tempo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ris.</note> 
                  <hi>and unprofitable and impertinent diſcourſe,</hi> of which I ſpake ſomething before under the third head. Indeed <hi>viſits</hi> may be prudently ordered, and ſpent in ſuch diſcourſe as is very profitable, and then they will not be only <hi>teſtifications of civility and reſpect</hi> from one friend to another, but a <hi>great advantage</hi> and <hi>improvement</hi> to them <hi>many wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Immoderate and too long ſports, games and recreations.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome fiting <hi>recreation</hi> may be needfull to him who has wearied himſelf in honeſt labour. He that mowes muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times whet his ſythe, and he that travails muſt ſometimes bait. And therefore recreations that are lawful, moderate and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and conduce to the refreſhment of nature, and fitting us more for our buſineſs, are very allowable; but too much and too long recreation is a moſt prodigal expence of time. Nay there are ſome who labour hard and take great pains at their ſports and recreations, who are very idle in their due work. And what a folly is this to be ſo active and labourious about their pleaſures and to neglect their main buſineſs?</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Vain impertinent</hi> and <hi>ungoverned thoughts</hi> are a great <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of time,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>melancholy perſons.</hi> But this alſo I touched before.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Reading of vain and corrupting books,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Play-books,</hi> &amp;c. is another great waſter of precious time. Surely we ſhould not imploy our time in reading any books but ſuch as tend to make us either wiſer or better, or more uſeful; not in ſuch as tend to the depraving and corrupting of our minds. Such waſters therefore of precious time as theſe are, ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoided by us. And ſo much of the ſixth Direction.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Conſider how exceeding comfortable the <hi>review of time well ſpent will be</hi> when you come to dye. <hi>What a ſtrong cordial</hi> is it to a <hi>departing ſoul</hi> when he can ſay <hi>with the bleſſed Apoſtle, I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the Righteous Judge ſhall give me at his appearing,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7, 8. Or with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Eſay. 38.3. <hi>Remember now O Lord how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which was good in thy ſight?</hi> 'Twas once ſaid by a <hi>holy man</hi> in this Nation, that <hi>if any uncomfortable Paſſion could betide a Saint in Heaven, it would be that he had ſpent his time no
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:66289:203"/> better nor had done God more ſervice here.</hi> And therefore the <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>renowned <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> cryed out on his Death-bed <hi>Lord pardon my omiſſions.</hi> But as the review of our time <hi>well ſpent and imployed</hi> will be exceeding comfortable to us at our <hi>dying hour,</hi> ſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary muſt needs be <hi>exceeding cutting.</hi> O how do people wiſh then they had ſpent their time! Which of theſe two accounts do you think will then be moſt comfortable? <hi>Item ſo much of my time</hi> ſpent in <hi>Ale-houſes, Taverns,</hi> in <hi>idle company,</hi> in <hi>pleaſures, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,</hi> in <hi>fooliſh mirth,</hi> and <hi>jollity,</hi> &amp;c. or <hi>ſo much of my time</hi> ſpent in fervent <hi>prayer</hi> to God, and praiſing of him, <hi>ſo much in hearing his word,</hi> in <hi>meditation,</hi> in <hi>ſelf-examination,</hi> in <hi>pious diſcourſe,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis hardly poſſible <hi>for voluptuous</hi> perſons, who have their minds filled with vanity &amp; pleaſure, to imagine what a different ſenſe they will have of things when they come to dye, from what they have now; and how precious that time will then appear to them which they made ſo little account of before. They will then begin to ſee their folly, as they ſay <hi>Moles</hi> have their eyes opened juſt before they die. And as <hi>Hagar</hi> ſat down and wept when her water was ſpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.15. So theſe people will then weep and howl when their time is gone and can never be recalled. And ſo much for the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to the manner how we ſhould redeem time.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I come now in the laſt place to ſhew who are the Perſons that ſhould eſpecially be perſwaded to the practice of this duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe that are young. They ſhould take heed of Satans grand deluſion, who will perſwade them (if he can) that 'tis too ſoon for them as yet to think of improving their time, and if they ſhould do ſo now they will loſe their prime time of pleaſure. But I ſhall refer them to my directions to the young in my book of knowledge and practice for the anſwering ſuch ſuggeſtions. They ſhould conſider how many great advantages will accrue to them if they now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their time well. Hereby they will prevent many ſins and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; hereby they will come to ſome eminency of knowledge grace and ſpiritual experience; hereby they will do God more ſervice in their lives, and their joyes and comforts will be greater when they come to be old, and their death will be more comfortable and their reward in Heaven much greater.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe who have loſt much time before. If a traveller hath loitered in the morning, he had need ſpur up and ride hard in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of the day, leſt the night overtake him and ſo diſable
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:66289:203"/> him from accompliſhing his journey. They that have loſt much precious time in the former part of their life, had need uſe dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diligence in well improving of it afterwards.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>ſick</hi> and <hi>aged.</hi> They ought to look upon their Sun as ſetting and their glaſs as almoſt run out. And therefore if ever they will beſtir themſelves to ſecure to themſelves a happy eternity they muſt do it now.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thoſe that at preſent enjoy more then ordinary Spiritual helps and advantages for the good of their ſouls, or ſuch oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities as they have not before met with. As when God caſts them into a good Family, or vouchſafes to them the help of ſome faithful Miniſter, or the example of ſome exemplary Chriſtians whoſe help they had not before. Thoſe to whom God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes ſuch advantages ſhould eſpecially be careful to improve them remembring that opportunity is the quinteſcence of time. A man may have a great deal of time and yet but few opportunities to effect an important buſineſs, and 'tis the character of a wiſe man to make a right improvement of the opportunities vouch-ſafed to him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thoſe that are in any office of <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> or <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have an eſpecial opportunity of doing good to many. They ſhould be very careful to improve this ſeaſon, for it will not alwayes laſt. If therefore thou art a Magiſtrate, conſider thou haſt now a great opportunity to encourage Piety, Vertue, and Honeſty, and to beat down Sin, Vice, and Wickedneſs. Do what thou canſt for God while thy Magiſtracy laſts. If thou art a Miniſter, Preach the word faithfully in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, Exhort, Reprove, Rebuke with all long-ſuffering and patience; ſtrive to win as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſouls to Chriſt as thou canſt. Thou knoweſt not how ſoon thy mouth may be ſtopped. And I may make the like addreſs to others alſo. If thou art rich, diſtribute and communicate to the poor whilſt thou haſt an eſtate; poſſibly it may be taken from thee, and then thou canſt not do it. If thou art a Parent or a Maſter of a Family, do good to the ſouls of thoſe under thy care while thou haſt time. Remember that both thy life and their lives are uncertain, and thou knoweſt not how long th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u mayeſt have opportunity to do it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Ignorant.</hi> They that have been hitherto ignorant ſhould conſider they muſt get knowledge if they intend to be ſaved;
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:66289:204"/> for without the knowledge of the main fundamental Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, how is it poſſible they ſhould be good Chriſtians or know what God requires of them in order to their Salvation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Thoſe that have been lately recovered from any dangerous ſickneſs. They ſhould remember that God has renewed the leaſe of their life, which poſſibly both themſelves and their friends thought expiring. They ſhould remember the reſolutions and promiſes which they then made to God, and poſſibly to others in their ſickneſs. It is ſaid of the Mariners that were in the Ship out of which <hi>Jonah</hi> was caſt, that when the Sea ceaſed from ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and all was ſafe, <hi>that the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a Sacrifice to the Lord and made vows,</hi> Jonah 1.16. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, they made vows after their deliverance. Many make vows in their danger that are little careful to perform them when the danger is over. But let all thoſe that love their Souls be careful to perform the vows they made to God in their ſickneſſes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes. And ſo much of this laſt particular, namely, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ought eſpecially to be perſwaded to the practice of this duty.</p>
